Sentence
"Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding"
"The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat"
"The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called ""runs"""
"The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases"
"A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).
The principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach"
"Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called ""out"" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting"
"The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners ""out"", which forces them out of the field of play"
"The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.
The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs"
One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning
"A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins"
"Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played"
"Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time.
Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century"
"This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed"
"Baseball's American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in American history such as the American Civil War and the Great Depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of ""America's Pastime""; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the United States, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as American football"
"In addition to North America, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
In Major League Baseball (MLB), the highest level of professional baseball in the United States and Canada, teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central"
The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series
The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League
"The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world"
"Baseball was played at the Olympic Games from 1992 to 2008, and was reinstated in 2020.


== Rules and gameplay ==

A baseball game is played between two teams, each usually composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding)"
"A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an inning"
"A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college, Minor League Baseball and, since the 2020 season, Major League Baseball; and six innings at the Little League level)"
"One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning"
"The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning"
The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team
"The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond"
"A player bats at home plate and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, counterclockwise, from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run"
"The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again"
"When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning"
"If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest"
"Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles"
The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory
The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield
"In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center"
"The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height"
"The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.There are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt:

The baseball is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9 inches (23 centimeters) in circumference"
"It has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching.
The bat is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood"
Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games
"It is a hard round stick, about 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob"
"Bats used by adults are typically around 34 inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42 inches (110 centimeters).
The glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers"
"As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.At the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players of the fielding team arrange themselves around the field"
"One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound"
"The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate"
"Another fielding team player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher"
"The rest of the fielding team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders"
"In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base"
"The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder"
"With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered"
A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher
"Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well.

Play starts with a member of the batting team, the batter, standing in either of the two batter's boxes next to home plate, holding a bat"
"The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with the bat"
The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher
"A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner)"
A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to be safe and is on base
A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely
A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit
A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single
"If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple"
"If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or if the batter-runner otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run"
This is the most desirable result for the batter
"The ultimate and most desirable result possible for a batter would be to hit a home run while all three bases are occupied or ""loaded"", thus scoring four runs on a single hit"
This is called a grand slam
"A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands"
"A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play, as only one runner may occupy a base at any given time"
"If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they occupied when the play began"
"If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after the ball is caught)"
Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a stolen base.A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball
A batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out
"A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base"
"(A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee"
"Any pitch which does not pass through the strike zone is called a ball, unless the batter either swings and misses at the pitch, or hits the pitch into foul territory; an exception generally occurs if the ball is hit into foul territory when the batter already has two strikes, in which case neither a ball nor a strike is called.

While the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs"
"In addition to the strikeout and flyout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out include the ground out, force out, and tag out"
"These occur either when a runner is forced to advance to a base, and a fielder with possession of the ball reaches that base before the runner does, or the runner is touched by the ball, held in a fielder's hand, while not on a base"
"(The batter-runner is always forced to advance to first base, and any other runners must advance to the next base if a teammate is forced to advance to their base.) It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play"
This is called a double play
"Three outs in one play, a triple play, is possible, though rare"
"Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench"
A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team
"Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty.An individual player's turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate"
"On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base)"
A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased
A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn
"Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat in the batting order"
"The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions"
"Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game"
"Children's games often have more lenient rules, such as Little League rules, which allow players to be substituted back into the same game.If the designated hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run)"
"The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field"
"Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.


== Personnel ==


=== Players ===

The number of players on a baseball roster, or squad, varies by league and by the level of organized play"
A Major League Baseball (MLB) team has a roster of 25 players with specific roles
"A typical roster features the following players:
Eight position players: the catcher, four infielders, and three outfielders—all of whom play on a regular basis
Five starting pitchers who constitute the team's pitching rotation or starting rotation
Six relief pitchers, including one closer, who constitute the team's bullpen (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up)
One backup, or substitute, catcher
Two backup infielders
Two backup outfielders
One pinch hitter, or a utility player, or a seventh relieverMost baseball leagues worldwide have the DH rule, including the MLB, Japan's Pacific League, and Caribbean professional leagues, along with major American amateur organizations"
The Central League in Japan does not have the rule and high-level minor league clubs connected to National League teams are not required to field a DH
"In leagues that apply the designated hitter rule, a typical team has nine offensive regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher, and two or three other reserve players.


=== Managers and coaches ===
The manager, or head coach, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers"
"Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning"
"At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, who occupy designated coaches' boxes, just outside the foul lines"
"These coaches assist in the direction of baserunners, when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners, during pauses in play"
"In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game.


=== Umpires ===
Any baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play"
"At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes"
"Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs"
"In MLB, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base"
"In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.


== Strategy ==

Many of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers"
"A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup, who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher, may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster"
"Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal"
"Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used"
"Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America, Ireland and Australia); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football"
"These various forms of football share to varying extents common origins and are known as ""football codes"".
There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world"
Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century
The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire
"By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage"
"In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations"
"During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.


== Common elements ==

The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.Common rules among the sports include:
Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.
A clearly defined area in which to play the game.
Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.
Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.
The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.
Players using only their body to move the ball, i.e"
"no additional equipment such as bats or sticks.In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking"
"In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts.


== Etymology ==

There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word ""football"""
"It is widely assumed that the word ""football"" (or the phrase ""foot ball"") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball"
"There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe that were played on foot"
"There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.


== Early history ==


=== Ancient games ===


==== Ancient China ====

The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠) resembles modern association football"
"It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and third centuries BC, attested by descriptions in a military manual"
"The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period"
This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD
"In kemari, several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie).


==== Ancient Greece and Rome ====
The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet"
"The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as ""ἐπίσκυρος"" (Episkyros) or ""φαινίνδα"" (phaininda), which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c"
150 – c
215 AD)
These games appear to have resembled rugby football
The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop
"Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis"
"Episkyros is described as an early form of football by FIFA.


==== Native Americans ====
There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world"
"For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit in Greenland"
"There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk"
"Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal"
"In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman"
"Pasuckuakohowog, a game similar to modern-day association football played amongst Amerindians, was also reported as early as the 17th century.
Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports"
"Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of ""football.""


==== Oceania ====
On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for ""game ball"")"
"The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: ""Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it."" Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football.
The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Ki-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.These games and others may well go far back into antiquity"
"However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.


==== Turkic peoples ====
Mahmud al-Kashgari in his Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk, described a game called ""tepuk"" among Turks in Central Asia"
"In the game, people try to attack each other's castle by kicking a ball made of sheep leather.

		
		
		
		
		


=== Medieval and early modern Europe ===

The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England"
"An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, which describes ""a party of boys .."
"playing at ball"""
"References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, date from the 12th century.

The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as ""mob football"", would be played in towns or between neighbouring villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse, struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes"
"The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter, and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).
The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183"
"He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:

After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game"
The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls
"Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.
Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of ""ball play"" or ""playing at ball"""
"This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.
An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England:  ""Henry.."
while playing at ball.
"ran against David"""
"Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a ""football game"" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard"
"Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England: ""[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his.."
"ran against him and wounded himself"".In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time"
"A translation reads: ""[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."" This is the earliest reference to football.
In 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning ""...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games"", showing that ""football"" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.

A game known as ""football"" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906"
"There is evidence for schoolboys playing a ""football"" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball"
"The word ""pass"" in the most recent translation is derived from ""huc percute"" (strike it here) and later ""repercute pilam"" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin"
It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team
"The original word translated as ""goal"" is ""metum"", literally meaning the ""pillar at each end of the circus course"" in a Roman chariot race"
"There is a reference to ""get hold of the ball before [another player] does"" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed"
"One sentence states in the original 1930 translation ""Throw yourself against him"" (Age, objice te illi).
King Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word ""football"", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for ""foteball"".There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire"
"This is the first description of a ""kicking game"" and the first description of dribbling: ""[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game"
"It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet.."
"kicking in opposite directions."" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: ""[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.

Other firsts in the medieval and early modern eras:

""a football"", in the sense of a ball rather than a game, was first mentioned in 1486"
This reference is in Dame Juliana Berners' Book of St Albans
"It states: ""a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal.""
a pair of football boots were ordered by King Henry VIII of England in 1526.
women playing a form of football was first described in 1580 by Sir Philip Sidney in one of his poems: ""[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes.""
the first references to goals are in the late 16th and early 17th centuries"
"In 1584 and 1602 respectively, John Norden and Richard Carew referred to ""goals"" in Cornish hurling"
"Carew described how goals were made: ""they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales"""
"He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players.
the first direct reference to scoring a goal is in John Day's play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (performed circa 1600; published 1659): ""I'll play a gole at camp-ball"" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in East Anglia)"
"Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to ""when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe"".


=== Calcio Fiorentino ===

In the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as ""calcio storico"" (""historic kickball"") in the Piazza Santa Croce"
The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football
"For example, calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents"
Blows below the belt were allowed
The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise
"In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino"
This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game
"The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).


=== Official disapproval and attempts to ban football ===

There have been many attempts to ban football, from the middle ages through to the modern day"
"The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.: 6  Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s"
"Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.
American football also faced pressures to ban the sport"
"The game played in the 19th century resembled mob football that developed in medieval Europe, including a version popular on university campuses known as old division football, and several municipalities banned its play in the mid-19th century"
"By the 20th century, the game had evolved to a more rugby style game"
"In 1905, there were calls to ban American football in the U.S"
"due to its violence; a meeting that year was hosted by American president Theodore Roosevelt led to sweeping rules changes that caused the sport to diverge significantly from its rugby roots to become more like the sport as it is played today.


== Establishment of modern codes ==


=== English public schools ===

While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes"
"First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its ""mob"" form and turning it into an organised team sport"
"Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools"
"Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools"
"Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between ""kicking"" and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games first became clear.
The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519"
"Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase ""We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde"".Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as ""the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football"""
Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football
"Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (""sides"" and ""parties""), positions (""standings""), a referee (""judge over the parties"") and a coach ""(trayning maister)"""
"Mulcaster's ""footeball"" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:

[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously .."
"may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.
In 1633, David Wedderburn, a teacher from Aberdeen, mentioned elements of modern football games in a short Latin textbook called Vocabula"
"Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as ""keeping goal"" and makes an allusion to passing the ball (""strike it here"")"
"There is a reference to ""get hold of the ball"", suggesting that some handling was allowed"
"It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (""drive that man back"").A more detailed description of football is given in Francis Willughby's Book of Games, written in about 1660"
"Willughby, who had studied at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield, is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: ""a close that has a gate at either end"
"The gates are called Goals."" His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field"
"He also mentions tactics (""leaving some of their best players to guard the goal""); scoring (""they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win"") and the way teams were selected (""the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"")"
"He is the first to describe a ""law"" of football: ""they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball"".English public schools were the first to codify football games"
"In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century"
"In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were ""off their side"" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective"
"Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand"
"They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation"
"However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850"
"The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815 and Aldenham in 1825.)
During the early 19th century, most working-class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day"
"They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many children were part of the labour force"
Feast day football played on the streets was in decline
"Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop"
"A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three"
"After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws"
"The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill"
"On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard"
"It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.
The five players on each side fall into five playing positions"
"The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning)"
"Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports"
"The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition (drawing most of its talent from U.S"
college basketball)
"Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas"
The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world
"Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup.
The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships"
"The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.


== History ==


=== Creation ===

In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical education and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day"
He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters
"After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall"
Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track
"Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each ""basket"" or point scored"
"This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket.

Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball"
"These round balls from ""association football"" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in"
These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable
"Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith (whereas in American football, the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day)"
"The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use"
"Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the ""bounce pass"" to teammates"
Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement
Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls
"Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble by 1898.The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards"
"A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through"
"Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point"
Whichever team got the most points won the game
"The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots"
The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots
"Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called duck on a rock, as many had failed before it.Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game"
Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started
"Mahan suggested that it be called ""Naismith ball"", at which he laughed, saying that a name like that would kill any game"
"Mahan then said, ""Why not call it basketball?"" Naismith replied, ""We have a basket and a ball, and it seems to me that would be a good name for it."" The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players"
"The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court.
At the time, soccer was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11)"
"When winter weather got too icy to play soccer, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side"
"By 1897–1898 teams of five became standard.


=== College basketball ===

Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through the United States and Canada"
"By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools"
"While YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from YMCA's primary mission"
"However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void"
"In the years before World War I, the Amateur Athletic Union and the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (forerunner of the NCAA) vied for control over the rules for the game"
"The first pro league, the National Basketball League, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game"
"This league only lasted five years.
James Naismith was instrumental in establishing college basketball"
His colleague C
O
Beamis fielded the first college basketball team just a year after the Springfield YMCA game at the suburban Pittsburgh Geneva College
"Naismith himself later coached at the University of Kansas for six years, before handing the reins to renowned coach Forrest ""Phog"" Allen"
"Naismith's disciple Amos Alonzo Stagg brought basketball to the University of Chicago, while Adolph Rupp, a student of Naismith's at Kansas, enjoyed great success as coach at the University of Kentucky"
"On February 9, 1895, the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at Hamline University between Hamline and the School of Agriculture, which was affiliated with the University of Minnesota"
"The School of Agriculture won in a 9–3 game.
In 1901, colleges, including the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, the University of Minnesota, the U.S"
"Naval Academy, the University of Colorado and Yale University began sponsoring men's games"
"In 1905, frequent injuries on the football field prompted President Theodore Roosevelt to suggest that colleges form a governing body, resulting in the creation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS)"
"In 1910, that body changed its name to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)"
"The first Canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at YMCA in Kingston, Ontario on February 6, 1904, when McGill University – Naismith's alma mater – visited Queen's University"
"McGill won 9–7 in overtime; the score was 7–7 at the end of regulation play, and a ten-minute overtime period settled the outcome"
"A good turnout of spectators watched the game.The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) tournament, was organized in 1937"
"The first national championship for NCAA teams, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national tournament began one year later"
"College basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in match fixing and point shaving"
"Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the NCAA tournament.


=== High school basketball ===

Before widespread school district consolidation, most American high schools were far smaller than their present-day counterparts"
"During the first decades of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements"
"In the days before widespread television coverage of professional and college sports, the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of America"
"Perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was Indiana's Franklin Wonder Five, which took the nation by storm during the 1920s, dominating Indiana basketball and earning national recognition.
Today virtually every high school in the United States fields a basketball team in varsity competition"
"Basketball's popularity remains high, both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire community, as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after graduation"
"In the 2016–17 season, 980,673 boys and girls represented their schools in interscholastic basketball competition, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations"
"The states of Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky are particularly well known for their residents' devotion to high school basketball, commonly called Hoosier Hysteria in Indiana; the critically acclaimed film Hoosiers shows high school basketball's depth of meaning to these communities.

⁣There is currently no tournament to determine a national high school champion"
The most serious effort was the National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament at the University of Chicago from 1917 to 1930
The event was organized by Amos Alonzo Stagg and sent invitations to state champion teams
The tournament started out as a mostly Midwest affair but grew
In 1929 it had 29 state champions
Faced with opposition from the National Federation of State High School Associations and North Central Association of Colleges and Schools that bore a threat of the schools losing their accreditation the last tournament was in 1930
The organizations said they were concerned that the tournament was being used to recruit professional players from the prep ranks
"The tournament did not invite minority schools or private/parochial schools.
The National Catholic Interscholastic Basketball Tournament ran from 1924 to 1941 at Loyola University"
"The National Catholic Invitational Basketball Tournament from 1954 to 1978 played at a series of venues, including Catholic University, Georgetown and George Mason"
The National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament for Black High Schools was held from 1929 to 1942 at Hampton Institute
The National Invitational Interscholastic Basketball Tournament was held from 1941 to 1967 starting out at Tuskegee Institute
Following a pause during World War II it resumed at Tennessee State College in Nashville
The basis for the champion dwindled after 1954 when Brown v
Board of Education began an integration of schools
"The last tournaments were held at Alabama State College from 1964 to 1967.


=== Professional basketball ===

Teams abounded throughout the 1920s"
"There were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game"
Players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls
Leagues came and went
"Barnstorming squads such as the Original Celtics and two all-African American teams, the New York Renaissance Five (""Rens"") and the (still existing) Harlem Globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours.
In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed"
"The first game was played in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November 1, 1946"
"Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA)"
"By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball"
"In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site of the first game"
"Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of the game"
The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball
"An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976"
"Today the NBA is the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
The NBA has featured many famous players, including George Mikan, the first dominating ""big man""; ball-handling wizard Bob Cousy and defensive genius Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics; charismatic center Wilt Chamberlain, who originally played for the barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters; all-around stars Oscar Robertson and Jerry West; more recent big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone; playmakers John Stockton, Isiah Thomas and Steve Nash; crowd-pleasing forwards Julius Erving and Charles Barkley; European stars Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol and Tony Parker; Latin American stars Manu Ginobili, more recent superstars, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, etc; and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of popularity during the 1980s and 1990s: Larry Bird, Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson, and Michael Jordan.
In 2001, the NBA formed a developmental league, the National Basketball Development League (later known as the NBA D-League and then the NBA G League after a branding deal with Gatorade)"
"As of the 2021–22 season, the G League has 30 teams.


=== International basketball ===

FIBA (International Basketball Federation) was formed in 1932 by eight founding nations: Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland"
"At this time, the organization only oversaw amateur players"
"Its acronym, derived from the French Fédération Internationale de Basket-ball Amateur, was thus ""FIBA"""
"Men's basketball was first included at the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics, although a demonstration tournament was held in 1904"
"The United States defeated Canada in the first final, played outdoors"
"This competition has usually been dominated by the United States, whose team has won all but three titles"
"The first of these came in a controversial final game in Munich in 1972 against the Soviet Union, in which the ending of the game was replayed three times until the Soviet Union finally came out on top"
"Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch"
The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposite team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing side
"Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes"
"With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is considered the world's most popular sport.
The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886"
The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference
"The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal"
"When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball"
"Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area"
The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner
"Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout.Internationally, association football is governed by FIFA"
"Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA"
National associations (e.g
"The FA or JFA) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game"
The most senior and prestigious international competitions are the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup
"The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic Games"
"The two most prestigious competitions in European club football are the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League, which attract an extensive television audience throughout the world"
"The final of the men's tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.Women's association football has historically seen opposition, with national associations severely curbing its development and several outlawing it completely"
Restrictions started to be reduced in the 1970s and the first official women's World Cup was the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup in China with only 12 teams from the respective six confederations
"By the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France, this had increased to 24 national teams, and a record-breaking 1.12 billion viewers watched the competition.


== Name ==

Association football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity"
"Within the English-speaking world, the sport is now usually called ""football"" in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually call it ""soccer"" in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent, such as Australia, Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster), and the United States; in Japan, the game is also primarily called sakkācode: jpn promoted to code: ja  (サッカーcode: jpn promoted to code: ja ), derived from ""soccer"""
"A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, ""football"" has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and rugby league.The term soccer comes from Oxford ""-er"" slang, which was prevalent at the University of Oxford in England from about 1875, and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of Rugby School"
"Initially spelled assoccer, it was later reduced to the modern spelling"
"This form of slang also gave rise to rugger for rugby football, fiver and tenner for five pound and ten pound notes, and the now-archaic footer that was also a name for association football"
"The word soccer arrived at its final form in 1895 and was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of socca.


== History ==

Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures"
Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games
An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a stele of c. 375–400 BCE in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy
"Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE, mentions the Roman ball game harpastumcode: lat promoted to code: la"
"Phaininda, episkyros and harpastumcode: lat promoted to code: la  were played involving hands and violence"
"They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football"
"As with pre-codified mob football, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking it.The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally ""kick ball""; also known as tsu chu) resembles modern association football"
Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was to kick a ball through an opening into a net
"During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were established"
Other East Asian games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea
"The Japanese kemari, influenced by cuju, originated around the year 600 during the Asuka period"
"It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a mari, a ball made of animal skin"
"In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was described as ""almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals"".Association football in itself does not have a classical history"
"Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world, FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe"
The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England
"The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century.

The Cambridge rules, first drawn up at the University of Cambridge in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football"
"The Cambridge rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools"
They were not universally adopted
"During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football"
"Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to the formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867"
"In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London"
The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse
"The Freemasons' Tavern was the setting for five more meetings of The FA between October and December 1863; the English FA eventually issued the first comprehensive set of rules named Laws of the Game, forming modern football"
"At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath F.C., withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding"
"Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA, and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union"
"The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game"
"These rules included handling of the ball by ""marks"" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia"
"The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s, with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.
The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by the footballer and cricketer Charles W"
"Alcock, and has been contested by English teams since 1872"
"The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of Alcock"
"England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor"
The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.Laws of the Game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB)
"The board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of the Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association"
"FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to the Laws of the Game of the Football Association"
The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913
"The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.For most of the 20th century, Europe and South America were the dominant regions in association football"
"The FIFA World Cup, inaugurated in 1930, became the main stage for players of both continents to show their worth and the strength of their national teams"
"In the second half of the century, the European Cup and the Copa Libertadores were created, and the champions of these two club competitions would contest the Intercontinental Cup to prove which team was the best in the world.In the 21st century, South America has continued to produce some of the best footballers in the world, but its clubs have fallen behind the still dominant European clubs, which often sign the best players from Latin America and elsewhere"
"Meanwhile, football has improved in Africa, Asia and North America, and nowadays, these regions are at least on equal grounds with South America in club football, although countries in the Caribbean and Oceania regions (except Australia) have yet to make a mark in international football"
"When it comes to national teams, however, Europeans and South Americans continue to dominate the FIFA World Cup, as no team from any other region has managed to even reach the final.Football is played at a professional level all over the world"
"Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet"
A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level
"According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football"
"Football has the highest global television audience in sport.In many parts of the world, football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations"
"Ryszard Kapuściński says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games"
"The Ivory Coast national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time"
"By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras"
"The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.


=== Women's association football ===

Women may have been playing football for as long as the game has existed"
"Evidence shows that a similar ancient game (cuju, or tsu chu) was played by women during the Han dynasty (25–220 CE), as female figures are depicted in frescoes of the period playing tsu chu"
"There are also reports of annual football matches played by women in Midlothian, Scotland, during the 1790s.

Association football, the modern game, has documented early involvement of women"
"In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play"
The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow
"In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895"
"Women's football has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.The best-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894"
It was named the British Ladies' Football Club
"Honeyball is quoted as, ""I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured"
"I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most."" Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football"
"However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations and continued without their support"
"It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the ""masculinity"" of the game.Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when female employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men 50 years earlier"
"The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr Ladies F.C"
"of Preston, England"
"The team played in one of the first women's international matches against a French XI team in 1920, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in the same year, winning 22–0.Despite being more popular than some men's football events, with one match seeing a 53,000 strong crowd in 1920, women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on association members' pitches, stating that ""the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged"""
"Players and football writers have argued that this ban was, in fact, due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted, and because the FA had no control over the money made from the women's game"
"The FA ban led to the formation of the short-lived English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.

Association football continued to be played by women since the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century"
"In December 1969, the Women's Football Association was formed in England, and in 1971, Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) members voted to officially recognise women's football"
"Also in 1971, The Football Association rescinded the ban that prohibited women from playing on association members' pitches"
"In the late 1960s and early 1970s, women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for British women"
"Women's football also faced bans in several other countries, notably in Brazil from 1941 to 1979, in France from 1941 to 1970, and in Germany from 1955 to 1970.Women's football still faces many struggles, but its worldwide growth has seen major competitions being launched at both the national and international levels, mirroring the men's competitions"
"The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since, while women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996"
"North America is the dominant region in women's football, with the United States winning most FIFA Women's World Cups and Olympic tournaments"
"Europe and Asia come second and third in terms of international success, and the women's game has been improving in South America.


== Gameplay ==

Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game"
"The game is played using a spherical ball of 68–70 cm (27–28 in) circumference, known as the football (or soccer ball)"
"Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal"
The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw
"Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or penalty kicks.The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart"
"Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, ""heading"" with the forehead) other than their hands or arms"
"Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper"
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence of humans and other animals"
"Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require ""intelligence"" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect"
"For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an ""AI winter""), followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding"
"AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior"
"In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools"
"The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects"
General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals
"To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics"
"AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence ""can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it"""
"This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity"
Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals
"The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's true technological capabilities.


== History ==

Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R"
"These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.The study of mechanical or ""formal"" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity"
"The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as ""0"" and ""1"", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction"
This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Church–Turing thesis
"This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain"
"The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete ""artificial neurons"".By the 1950s, two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged"
"One vision, known as Symbolic AI or GOFAI, was to use computers to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that could reason about the world"
"Proponents included Allen Newell, Herbert A"
"Simon, and Marvin Minsky"
"Closely associated with this approach was the ""heuristic search"" approach, which likened intelligence to a problem of exploring a space of possibilities for answers.
The second vision, known as the connectionist approach, sought to achieve intelligence through learning"
"Proponents of this approach, most prominently Frank Rosenblatt, sought to connect Perceptron in ways inspired by connections of neurons"
James Manyika and others have compared the two approaches to the mind (Symbolic AI) and the brain (connectionist)
"Manyika argues that symbolic approaches dominated the push for artificial intelligence in this period, due in part to its connection to intellectual traditions of Descartes, Boole, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and others"
Connectionist approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were pushed to the background but have gained new prominence in recent decades.The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956
The attendees became the founders and leaders of AI research
"They and their students produced programs that the press described as ""astonishing"": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S"
was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world.Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field
"Herbert Simon predicted, ""machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do"""
"Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, ""within a generation .."
"the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved"".They had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks"
"Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S"
and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI
"The next few years would later be called an ""AI winter"", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts"
"By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars"
"At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S"
and British governments to restore funding for academic research
"However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.Many researchers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition"
"A number of researchers began to look into ""sub-symbolic"" approaches to specific AI problems"
"Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move, survive, and learn their environment.Interest in neural networks and ""connectionism"" was revived by Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart and others in the middle of the 1980s"
"Soft computing tools were developed in the 1980s, such as neural networks, fuzzy systems, Grey system theory, evolutionary computation and many tools drawn from statistics or mathematical optimization.
AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by finding specific solutions to specific problems"
"The narrow focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results, exploit more mathematical methods, and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics)"
"By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as ""artificial intelligence"".Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012"
"According to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a ""sporadic usage"" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects"
"He attributed this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had ""incorporated AI in some offerings or processes"""
"The amount of research into AI (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.Numerous academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines"
"Much of current research involves statistical AI, which is overwhelmingly used to solve specific problems, even highly successful techniques such as deep learning"
"This concern has led to the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or ""AGI""), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.


== Goals ==
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems"
These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display
"The traits described below have received the most attention.


=== Reasoning, problem-solving ===
Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions"
"By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.Many of these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a ""combinatorial explosion"": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger"
Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model
"They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.


=== Knowledge representation ===

Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts.
A representation of ""what exists"" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them"
"The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern)"
A truly intelligent program would also need access to commonsense knowledge; the set of facts that an average person knows
"The semantics of an ontology is typically represented in description logic, such as the Web Ontology Language.AI research has developed tools to represent specific domains, such as objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);"
default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); as well as other domains
"Among the most difficult problems in AI are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as ""facts"" or ""statements"" that they could express verbally).Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining ""interesting"" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.


=== Learning ===

Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception, is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.Unsupervised learning finds patterns in a stream of input.
Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification and numerical regression"
Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in – the program sees a number of examples of things from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs
Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change
"Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as ""function approximators"" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, ""spam"" or ""not spam"".In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones"
"The agent classifies its responses to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.


=== Natural language processing ===

Natural language processing (NLP)
allows machines to read and understand human language"
"A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts"
"Some straightforward applications of NLP include information retrieval, question answering and machine translation.
Symbolic AI used formal syntax to translate the deep structure of sentences into logic"
"This failed to produce useful applications, due to the intractability of logic and the breadth of commonsense knowledge"
"Modern statistical techniques include co-occurrence frequencies (how often one word appears near another), ""Keyword spotting"" (searching for a particular word to retrieve information), transformer-based deep learning (which finds patterns in text), and others"
"They have achieved acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, and, by 2019, could generate coherent text.


=== Perception ===

Machine perception
is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world"
"Applications include speech recognition,facial recognition, and object recognition.
Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.


=== Social intelligence ===

Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.
For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.
However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are"
"Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.


=== General intelligence ===

A machine with general intelligence can solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence"
There are several competing ideas about how to develop artificial general intelligence
"Hans Moravec and Marvin Minsky argue that work in different individual domains can be incorporated into an advanced multi-agent system or cognitive architecture with general intelligence.Pedro Domingos hopes that there is a conceptually straightforward, but mathematically difficult, ""master algorithm"" that could lead to AGI.
Others believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain
or simulated child development
will someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.


== Tools ==


=== Search and optimization ===

AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions"
Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search
"For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule"
"Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis"
"Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.Simple exhaustive searches
are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers"
The result is a search that is too slow or never completes
"The solution, for many problems, is to use ""heuristics"" or ""rules of thumb"" that prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps"
"In some search methodologies, heuristics can also serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called ""pruning the search tree"")"
"Heuristics supply the program with a ""best guess"" for the path on which the solution lies.
Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.

A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization"
"For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made"
"These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top"
"Other related optimization algorithms include random optimization, beam search and metaheuristics like simulated annealing"
Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search
"For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses)"
"Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, gene expression programming, and genetic programming"
"Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms"
"Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).


=== Logic ===

Logic
is used for knowledge representation and problem-solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well"
"For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning
and inductive logic programming is a method for learning.Several different forms of logic are used in AI research"
"Propositional logic involves truth functions such as ""or"" and ""not"""
"First-order logic
adds quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other"
"Fuzzy logic assigns a ""degree of truth"" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as ""Alice is old"" (or rich, or tall, or hungry), that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false.Default logics, non-monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem.
Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as description logics;situation calculus, event calculus and fluent calculus (for representing events and time);causal calculus;belief calculus (belief revision); and modal logics.
Logics to model contradictory or inconsistent statements arising in multi-agent systems have also been designed, such as paraconsistent logics.


=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===

Many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information"
"AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.Bayesian networks
are a very general tool that can be used for various problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).
Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).A key concept from the science of economics is ""utility"", a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent"
"Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,
and information value theory"
"These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.


=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===

The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (""if shiny then diamond"") and controllers (""if diamond then pick up"")"
"Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems"
Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match
"They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI"
These examples are known as observations or patterns
"In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class"
A class is a decision that has to be made
Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering
"Robotics involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots"
The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans
"Robotics integrates fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, information engineering, mechatronics engineering, electronics, biomedical engineering, computer engineering, control systems engineering, software engineering, mathematics, etc.
Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions"
"Robots can be used in many situations for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g., in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation)"
"Robots can take any form, but some are made to resemble humans in appearance"
This is claimed to help in the acceptance of robots in certain replicative behaviors which are usually performed by people
"Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other tasks mainly performed by a human"
"Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.
Certain robots require user input to operate, while other robots function autonomously"
"The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century"
"Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion"
"Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily"
"Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks"
"Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid.


== Etymology ==
The word robotics was derived from the word robot, which was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R"
"(Rossum's Universal Robots), which was published in 1920"
"The word robot comes from the Slavic word robota, which means work/job"
"The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots, creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids"
Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word
"He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother Josef Čapek as its actual originator.According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word robotics was first used in print by Isaac Asimov, in his science fiction short story ""Liar!"", published in May 1941 in Astounding Science Fiction"
"Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term; since the science and technology of electrical devices is electronics, he assumed robotics already referred to the science and technology of robots"
"In some of Asimov's other works, he states that the first use of the word robotics was in his short story Runaround (Astounding Science Fiction, March 1942), where he introduced his concept of The Three Laws of Robotics"
"However, the original publication of ""Liar!"" predates that of ""Runaround"" by ten months, so the former is generally cited as the word's origin.


== History ==

In 1948, Norbert Wiener formulated the principles of cybernetics, the basis of practical robotics.
Fully autonomous robots only appeared in the second half of the 20th century"
"The first digitally operated and programmable robot, the Unimate, was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them"
"Commercial and industrial robots are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply, more accurately, and more reliably than humans"
"They are also employed in some jobs which are too dirty, dangerous, or dull to be suitable for humans"
"Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly, packing and packaging, mining, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, safety, and the mass production of consumer and industrial goods.


== Robotic aspects ==

There are many types of robots; they are used in many different environments and for many different uses"
"Although being very diverse in application and form, they all share three basic similarities when it comes to their construction:

Robots all have some kind of mechanical construction, a frame, form or shape designed to achieve a particular task"
"For example, a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud might use caterpillar tracks"
The mechanical aspect of the robot is mostly the creator's solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it
"Form follows function.
Robots have electrical components that power and control the machinery"
"For example, the robot with caterpillar tracks would need some kind of power to move the tracker treads"
"That power comes in the form of electricity, which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery, a basic electrical circuit"
"Even petrol-powered machines that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol-powered machines like cars, have batteries"
"The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status), and operation (robots need some level of electrical energy supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations)
All robots contain some level of computer programming code"
A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something
"In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not be able to go anywhere without a program telling it to move"
"Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly structured, its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all)"
"There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence, and hybrid"
"A robot with remote control programming has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with remote control"
It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics
"Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming"
"A hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions in them.


== Applications ==
As more and more robots are designed for specific tasks, this method of classification becomes more relevant"
"For example, many robots are designed for assembly work, which may not be readily adaptable for other applications"
"They are termed ""assembly robots"""
"For seam welding, some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot i.e"
"the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables, etc"
as an integrated unit
"Such an integrated robotic system is called a ""welding robot"" even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks"
"Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labeled as ""heavy-duty robots"".Current and potential applications include:

Military robots.
Industrial robots"
Robots are increasingly used in manufacturing (since the 1960s)
"According to the Robotic Industries Association US data, in 2016 the automotive industry was the main customer of industrial robots with 52% of total sales"
"In the auto industry, they can amount for more than half of the ""labor"""
"There are even ""lights off"" factories such as an IBM keyboard manufacturing factory in Texas that was fully automated as early as 2003.
Cobots (collaborative robots).
Construction robots"
"Construction robots can be separated into three types: traditional robots, robotic arm, and robotic exoskeleton.
Agricultural robots (AgRobots)"
The use of robots in agriculture is closely linked to the concept of AI-assisted precision agriculture and drone usage
"1996-1998 research also proved that robots can perform a herding task.
Medical robots of various types (such as da Vinci Surgical System and Hospi).
Kitchen automation"
"Commercial examples of kitchen automation are Flippy (burgers), Zume Pizza (pizza), Cafe X (coffee), Makr Shakr (cocktails), Frobot (frozen yogurts) and Sally (salads)"
"Home examples are Rotimatic (flatbreads baking) and Boris (dishwasher loading).
Robot combat for sport – hobby or sports event where two or more robots fight in an arena to disable each other"
"This has developed from a hobby in the 1990s to several TV series worldwide.
Cleanup of contaminated areas, such as toxic waste or nuclear facilities.
Domestic robots.
Nanorobots.
Swarm robotics.
Autonomous drones.
Sports field line marking.
Educational robotics"
"Robots such as LEGO® Mindstorms and Ozobots are used to teach coding, mathematics, and creative skills.


== Components ==


=== Power source ===

At present, mostly (lead–acid) batteries are used as a power source"
Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots
"They range from lead–acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver–cadmium batteries which are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive"
"Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime, and weight"
"Generators, often some type of internal combustion engine, can also be used"
"However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need fuel, require heat dissipation, and are relatively heavy"
A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely
This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere
"However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage"
"Potential power sources could be:

pneumatic (compressed gases)
Solar power (using the sun's energy and converting it into electrical power)
hydraulics (liquids)
flywheel energy storage
organic garbage (through anaerobic digestion)

=== Actuation ===

Actuators are the ""muscles"" of a robot, the parts which convert stored energy into movement"
"By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories"
"There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air.


==== Electric motors ====

The vast majority of robots use electric motors, often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and CNC machines"
"These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational.


==== Linear actuators ====

Various types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning, and often have quicker direction changes, particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics"
They are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air (pneumatic actuator) or an oil (hydraulic actuator) Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew
"Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator that is turned by hand, such as a rack and pinion on a car.


==== Series elastic actuators ====
Series elastic actuation (SEA) relies on the idea of introducing intentional elasticity between the motor actuator and the load for robust force control"
"Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia, series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment (e.g., humans or workpieces) or during collisions"
"Furthermore, it also provides energy efficiency and shock absorption (mechanical filtering) while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components"
"This approach has successfully been employed in various robots, particularly advanced manufacturing robots and walking humanoid robots.The controller design of a series elastic actuator is most often performed within the passivity framework as it ensures the safety of interaction with unstructured environments"
"Despite its remarkable stability and robustness, this framework suffers from the stringent limitations imposed on the controller which may trade-off performance"
The reader is referred to the following survey which summarizes the common controller architectures for SEA along with the corresponding sufficient passivity conditions
"One recent study has derived the necessary and sufficient passivity conditions for one of the most common impedance control architectures, namely velocity-sourced SEA"
"This work is of particular importance as it drives the non-conservative passivity bounds in an SEA scheme for the first time which allows a larger selection of control gains.


==== Air muscles ====

Pneumatic artificial muscles also known as air muscles, are special tubes that expand (typically up to 42%) when air is forced inside them"
"They are used in some robot applications.


==== Wire muscles ====

Muscle wire, also known as shape memory alloy, Nitinol® or Flexinol® wire, is a material that contracts (under 5%) when electricity is applied"
"They have been used for some small robot applications.


==== Electroactive polymers ====

EAPs or EPAMs are a plastic material that can contract substantially (up to 380% activation strain) from electricity, and have been used in facial muscles and arms of humanoid robots, and to enable new robots to float, fly, swim or walk.


==== Piezo motors ====

Recent alternatives to DC motors are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors"
"These work on a fundamentally different principle, whereby tiny piezoceramic elements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion"
There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line
Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw
"The advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution, speed, and available force for their size"
"These motors are already available commercially, and being used on some robots.


==== Elastic nanotubes ====

Elastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in early-stage experimental development"
"The absence of defects in carbon nanotubes enables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent, with energy storage levels of perhaps 10 J/cm3 for metal nanotubes"
Human biceps could be replaced with an 8 mm diameter wire of this material
"Such compact ""muscle"" might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans.


=== Sensing ===

Sensors allow robots to receive information about a certain measurement of the environment, or internal components"
"This is essential for robots to perform their tasks, and act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response"
"They are used for various forms of measurements, to give the robots warnings about safety or malfunctions, and to provide real-time information about the task it is performing.


==== Touch ====

Current robotic and prosthetic hands receive far less tactile information than the human hand"
Recent research has developed a tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips
The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin
Electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core
"When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object"
"The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting the robotic grip on held objects.
Scientists from several European countries and Israel developed a prosthetic hand in 2009, called SmartHand, which functions like a real one—allowing patients to write with it, type on a keyboard, play piano and perform other fine movements"
"The prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feeling in its fingertips.


==== Vision ====

Computer vision is the science and technology of machines that see"
"As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images"
A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes
"Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves)"
The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created
"Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it"
"Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks"
"Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W"
"Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer"
The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server
The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies
The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.Private blockchains have been proposed for business use
"Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model ""snake oil""; however, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.


== History ==

Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation ""Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."" Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W"
Scott Stornetta
They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with
"In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block"
"Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008"
Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain
"The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes)"
"In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size"
"The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase"
"Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.
In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term ""planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain"""
"For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a 'game-changer' for their business.


== Structure and design ==

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks"
This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively
A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server
They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests
Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal
The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset
"It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending"
A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol
"A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:
infrastructure (hardware)
networking (node discovery, information propagation and verification)
consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)
data (blocks, transactions)
application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)


=== Blocks ===
Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree"
"Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two"
The linked blocks form a chain
"This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the genesis block (Block 0)"
"To assure the integrity of a block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork"
"In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others"
Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks
Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time
They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them
Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers
There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever
Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks
"Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.: ch"
"08  For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network"
There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation
"Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel manner.


==== Block time ====
The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain"
"By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable"
"In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions"
"The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.


==== Hard forks ====


=== Decentralization ===
By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates some risks that come with data being held centrally"
"The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking.In a  so-called ""51% attack"" a central entity gains control of more than half of a network and can then manipulate that specific blockchain record at will, allowing double-spending.Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography.: 5  A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain"
Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address
A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support
Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain
Data quality is maintained by massive database replication and computational trust
"No centralized ""official"" copy exists and no user is ""trusted"" more than any other"
Transactions are broadcast to the network using the software
Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis
"Early blockchains rely on energy-intensive mining nodes to validate transactions, add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes.: ch"
"08  Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes"
Later consensus methods include proof of stake
"The growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.


==== Finality ====
Finality is the level of confidence that the well-formed block recently appended to the blockchain will not be revoked in the future (is ""finalized"") and thus can be trusted"
"Most distributed blockchain protocols, whether proof of work or proof of stake, cannot guarantee the finality of a freshly committed block, and instead rely on ""probabilistic finality"": as the block goes deeper into a blockchain, it is less likely to be altered or reverted by a newly found consensus.Byzantine Fault Tolerance-based proof-of-stake protocols purport to provide so called ""absolute finality"": a randomly chosen validator proposes a block, the rest of validators vote on it, and, if a supermajority decision approves it, the block is irreversibly committed into the blockchain"
"A modification of this method, an ""economic finality"", is used in practical protocols, like the Casper protocol used in Ethereum: validators which sign two different blocks at the same position in the blockchain are subject to ""slashing"", where their leveraged stake is forfeited.


=== Openness ===
Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view"
"Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition"
An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain
"Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term ""blockchain"" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks"
These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases
"Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.: 30–31  Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision"
"Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that ""many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases,"" and ""without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion.""


==== Permissionless (public) blockchain ====
An advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed"
"This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include proof of work"
"To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles"
"While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper ""Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail"".
In 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China"
Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains
"As of April 2018, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.


==== Permissioned (private) blockchain ====

Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network"
"It has been argued that permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of decentralization, if carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless blockchains, which are often centralized in practice.


===== Disadvantages of permissioned blockchain =====
Nikolai Hampton argued in Computerworld that ""There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources"
"If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."" This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis like the financial crisis of 2007–08, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others, and ""the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort"
"It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it's time-consuming and expensive."" He also said, ""Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors"
"This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases.""


==== Blockchain analysis ====
The analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with the popularity of bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies"
"A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who wants access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the know-how"
"The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges and banks"
"The reason for this is accusations of blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies enabling illicit dark market trade of drugs, weapons, money laundering, etc"
"A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes"
"This is changing and now specialised tech companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges, law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat-crypto exchanges"
"The development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise the use of new cryptos such as Monero"
The question is about the public accessibility of blockchain data and the personal privacy of the very same data
"It is a key debate in cryptocurrency and ultimately in the blockchain.


=== Standardisation ===
In April 2016, Standards Australia submitted a proposal to the International Organization for Standardization to consider developing standards to support blockchain technology"
"This proposal resulted in the creation of ISO Technical Committee 307, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies"
"The technical committee has working groups relating to blockchain terminology, reference architecture, security and privacy, identity, smart contracts, governance and interoperability for blockchain and DLT, as well as standards specific to industry sectors and generic government requirements"
"More than 50 countries are participating in the standardization process together with external liaisons such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the European Commission, the International Federation of Surveyors, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).Many other national standards bodies and open standards bodies are also working on blockchain standards"
"These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and some individual participants in the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).


=== Centralized blockchain ===
Although most of blockchain implementation are decentralized and distributed, Oracle launched a centralized blockchain table feature in Oracle 21c database"
The Blockchain Table in Oracle 21c database is a centralized blockchain which provide immutable feature
"Compared to decentralized blockchains, centralized blockchains normally can provide a higher throughput and lower latency of transactions than consensus-based distributed blockchains.


== Types ==
Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains.


=== Public blockchains ===
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions"
"Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol)"
"Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.
Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.


=== Private blockchains ===
A private blockchain is permissioned"
One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators
Participant and validator access is restricted
"To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.


=== Hybrid blockchains ===
A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features"
"The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization and decentralization are used.


=== Sidechains ===
A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain"
"Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent digital assets) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate consensus algorithm, etc.).


=== Consortium blockchain ===
A consortium blockchain is a type of blockchain that combines elements of both public and private blockchains"
"In a consortium blockchain, a group of organizations come together to create and operate the blockchain, rather than a single entity"
The consortium members jointly manage the blockchain network and are responsible for validating transactions
"Consortium blockchains are permissioned, meaning that only certain individuals or organizations are allowed to participate in the network"
"In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system"
Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate
"The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels"
"Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane"
Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight
"Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.
Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common"
"Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss"
"Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes"
"Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct"
"Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries"
"These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss"
Human migration and conflict can also be a result
The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century
Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks in the future without action to limit warming
"Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops reduces climate change risks, although this may not be possible with increasing warming"
"Poorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet they have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.
Many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) level of warming"
"Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet"
"Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming ""well under 2 °C"""
"However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century"
"Limiting warming to 1.5 °C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Reducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels"
"This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use"
"Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities"
"Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and by farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.


== Terminology ==
Before the 1980s, when it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases were stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution, scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate.In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common"
"Though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes the totality of changes to Earth's climate system"
Global warming—used as early as 1975—became the more popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S
Senate
"Since the 2000s, climate change has increased in usage"
"Climate change can also refer more broadly to both human-caused changes or natural changes throughout Earth's history.Various scientists, politicians and media now use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming.


== Observed temperature rise ==

Multiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming"
The 2011–2020 decade warmed to an average 1.09 °C [0.95–1.20 °C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900)
"Surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2 °C per decade, with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1.2 °C above the pre-industrial era"
"Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased.There was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century"
"Climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores"
Thermometer records began to provide global coverage around 1850
"Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions"
Temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions
"There have been prehistorical episodes of global warming, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum"
"However, the modern observed rise in temperature and CO2 concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in Earth's history do not approach current rates.Evidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other observations"
"For example, changes to the natural water cycle have been predicted and observed, such as an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity"
"Flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring"
"Another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's surface and preventing it from radiating into space.Regions of the world warm at differing rates"
"The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet"
"Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature"
"This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation"
"The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean"
"The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.The Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere"
"The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice"
"As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat"
Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming
Arctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world
"Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened Gulf Stream, further changing the climate.


== Attribution of recent temperature rise ==

The climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)), decades or even centuries"
"Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is ""external"" to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth"
"Examples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.To determine the human contribution to climate change, known internal climate variability and natural external forcings need to be ruled out"
"A key approach is to determine unique ""fingerprints"" for all potential causes, then compare these fingerprints with observed patterns of climate change"
"For example, solar forcing can be ruled out as a major cause"
Its fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere
"Yet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing"
"Attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect.


=== Greenhouse gases ===

Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface"
"The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it"
"This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time"
"Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 °C warmer than it would have been in their absence"
"While water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks"
"On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as CO2 (~20%), tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore external forcings.Human activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative imbalance"
"In 2019, the concentrations of CO2 and methane had increased by about 48% and 160%, respectively, since 1750"
These CO2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years
"Concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years.

Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of CO2"
"Of these emissions, 75% was CO2, 18% was methane, 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% was fluorinated gases"
"CO2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity"
"Additional CO2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the CO2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser"
"Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction"
"Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser.Despite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for CO2"
"Land-surface sink processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, remove about 29% of annual global CO2 emissions"
The ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process
"First, CO2 dissolves in the surface water"
"Afterwards, the ocean's overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle"
"Over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted CO2.


=== Aerosols and clouds ===
Air pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale"
Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation
"From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed"
"This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, and is attributed to aerosols produced by dust, pollution and combustion of biofuels and fossil fuels"
"Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.Aerosols also have indirect effects on the Earth's radiation budget"
Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets
These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets
"They also reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight"
"Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming"
"Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise"
"Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2 °C by 2050.


=== Land surface changes ===

Humans change the Earth's surface mainly to create more agricultural land"
"Today, agriculture takes up 34% of Earth's land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.)"
"The amount of forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming"
"Deforestation releases CO2 contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more CO2 in the future"
"The main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce forestry/forest products (26%), short term shifting cultivation (24%), and wildfires (23%).The type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature"
"It impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation"
"For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight"
"Deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns"
"In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to a cooling effect"
"Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo"
"According to FAO, forest degradation aggravates the impacts of climate change as it reduces the carbon sequestration abilities of forests"
"Indeed, among their many benefits, forests also have the potential to reduce the impact of high temperatures.


=== Solar and volcanic activity ===

As the Sun is the Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system"
"Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards"
There has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth.Explosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era
"When the eruption is sufficiently strong (with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere), sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years"
The temperature signal lasts about twice as long
Renewable energy is energy from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale
"Renewable resources include sunlight, wind, the movement of water, and geothermal heat"
"Although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not"
"For example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation"
"Renewable energy is often used for electricity generation, heating and cooling"
"Renewable energy projects are typically large-scale, but they are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development"
"Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification, which has several benefits: electricity can move heat or objects efficiently, and is clean at the point of consumption"
"In addition, electrification with renewable energy is more efficient and therefore leads to significant reductions in primary energy requirements.From 2011 to 2021, renewable energy has grown from 20% to 28% of global electricity supply"
"Use of fossil energy shrank from 68% to 62%, and nuclear from 12% to 10%"
The share of hydropower decreased from 16% to 15% while power from sun and wind increased from 2% to 10%
Biomass and geothermal energy grew from 2% to 3%
"There are 3,146 gigawatts installed in 135 countries, while 156 countries have laws regulating the renewable energy sector"
"In 2021, China accounted for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity.Globally there are over 10 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer"
"Renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper and their share of total energy consumption is increasing, with a large majority of worldwide newly installed electricity capacity being renewable"
"In most countries, photovoltaic solar or onshore wind are the cheapest new-build electricity.Many nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of their total energy supply, with some generating over half their electricity from renewables"
A few countries generate all their electricity using renewable energy
National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the 2020s and beyond
"According to the IEA, to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, 90% of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources"
"Some studies have shown that a global transition to 100% renewable energy across all sectors – power, heat, transport and desalination – is feasible and economically viable"
"Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to fossil fuels, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries"
"Deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits"
However renewables are being hindered by hundreds of billions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies
In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for renewables such as solar power and wind power
"In 2022 the International Energy Agency asked countries to solve policy, regulatory, permitting and financing obstacles to adding more renewables, to have a better chance of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.


== Overview ==


=== Definition ===

Renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as sunlight, wind, tides, plant growth, and geothermal heat, as the International Energy Agency explains:
Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly"
"In its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth"
"Included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, biomass, geothermal resources, and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources.


=== Drivers and benefits ===
Renewable energy stands in contrast to fossil fuels, which are being used far more quickly than they are being replenished"
"Renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries"
"Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits"
Solar and wind power have got much cheaper
"In some cases it will be cheaper to transition to these sources as opposed to continuing to use the current, inefficient, fossil fuels"
"It would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels, and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that could amount to trillions of dollars annually"
"Multiple analyses of decarbonization strategies have found that quantified health benefits can significantly offset the costs of implementing these strategies.Climate change concerns, coupled with the continuing fall in the costs of some renewable energy equipment, such as wind turbines and solar panels, are driving increased use of renewables"
"New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the global financial crisis better than many other sectors"
"As of 2019, however, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, renewables overall share in the energy mix (including power, heat and transport) needs to grow six times faster, in order to keep the rise in average global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0 °C (3.6 °F) during the present century, compared to pre-industrial levels.


=== Scale ===

A household's solar panels, and batteries if they have them, can often either be used for just that household or if connected to an electrical grid can be aggregated with millions of others"
"Over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking, and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves"
"According to the research, a nation must reach a certain point in its growth before it can take use of more renewable energy"
"In our words, its addition changed how crucial input factors (labor and capital) connect to one another, lowering their overall elasticity and increasing the apparent economies of scale"
United Nations' eighth Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity
"At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply"
"Although many countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy these tend to be only for the power sector, including a 40% target of all electricity generated for the European Union by 2030.


=== Uses ===
Renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services.


==== Power generation ====
More than a quarter of electricity is generated from renewables as of 2021.


==== Heating and cooling ====
Solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180  GWth)"
Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China
"Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households"
"In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil"
"Heat pumps provide both heating and cooling, and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing priority Renewable thermal energy is also growing rapidly"
"About 10% of heating and cooling energy is from renewables.


==== Transportation ====

One of the efforts to decarbonize transportation is the increased use of electric vehicles (EVs)"
"Despite that and the use of biofuels, such as biojet, less than 4% of transport energy is from renewables"
"Occasionally hydrogen fuel cells are used for heavy transport.


== Mainstream technologies ==


=== Solar energy ===

Solar energy, radiant light and heat from the sun, is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, concentrated solar power (CSP), concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis"
Most new renewable energy is solar
"Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert, and distribute solar energy"
"Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air"
"Active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy, using solar collectors for heating, and solar power, converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).
A photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current (DC) by taking advantage of the photoelectric effect"
"Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, fast-growing industry, continues to improve its cost-effectiveness, and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP"
Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam
Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s
"CSP-Stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies.
In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that ""the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits"
"It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise"
These advantages are global
"Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared"""
"Solar power accounts for 505 GW annually, which is about 2% of the world's electricity"
"Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight; however, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions, geographic location and time of day"
"According to chapter 6 of the IPCC 2022 climate mitigation report, the global potential of direct solar energy far exceeds that of any other renewable energy resource"
It is well beyond the total amount of energy needed in order to support mitigation over the current century
"Australia has the largest proportion of solar electricity in the world, supplying 9.9% of the country's electrical demand in 2020"
"More than 30 per cent of Australian households now have rooftop solar PV, with a combined capacity exceeding 11 GW.


=== Wind power ===

Air flow can be used to run wind turbines"
Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power
"The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine"
"Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms"
"Typically, full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed"
"Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China"
"In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%.Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome"
"This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore, and likely also industrial use of new types of VAWT turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use"
"As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines.


=== Hydropower ===

Since water is about 800 times denser than air, even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea swell, can yield considerable amounts of energy"
"Water can generate electricity with a conversion efficiency of about 90%, which is the highest rate in renewable energy"
"There are many forms of water energy:

Historically, hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs, which are still popular in developing countries"
"The largest of them are the Three Gorges Dam (2003) in China and the Itaipu Dam (1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay.
Small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 50 MW of power"
They are often used on small rivers or as a low-impact development on larger rivers
"China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations.
Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir"
"The water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley (using channels, pipes and/or tunnels) until it is high above the valley floor, whereupon it can be allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine"
"A run-of-river plant may still produce a large amount of electricity, such as the Chief Joseph Dam on the Columbia River in the United States"
"However many run-of-the-river hydro power plants are micro hydro or pico hydro plants.Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010"
"Of the top 50 countries by percentage of electricity generated from renewables, 46 are primarily hydroelectric"
"There are now seven hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 GW (10,000 MW) worldwide, see table below.

Much hydropower is flexible, thus complementing wind and solar"
"Wave power, which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and tidal power, converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially"
"A demonstration project operated by the Ocean Renewable Power Company on the coast of Maine, and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power from the Bay of Fundy, location of the world's highest tidal flow"
"Ocean thermal energy conversion, which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, currently has no economic feasibility.


=== Bioenergy ===

Biomass is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms"
It commonly refers to plants or plant-derived materials
"As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel in solid, liquid or gaseous form"
"Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal, chemical, and biochemical methods"
"Wood was the largest biomass energy source as of 2012; examples include forest residues – such as dead trees, branches and tree stumps, yard clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid waste"
"Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including miscanthus, switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow, sorghum, sugarcane, bamboo, and a variety of tree species, ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm (palm oil).
Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy"
The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity
"Plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel.
Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy such as methane gas or transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel"
"Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gas – also called landfill gas or biogas"
"Crops, such as corn and sugarcane, can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel, ethanol"
"Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from left-over food products such as vegetable oils and animal fats"
"There is a great deal of research involving algal fuel or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it is a non-food resource, grows around 20 times faster than other types of food crops, such as corn and soy, and can be grown almost anywhere"
"Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, and methane, as well as biodiesel and hydrogen"
The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region
"Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the United States"
Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius (sugar cane residue) and Southeast Asia (rice husks)
"A carbon footprint (or greenhouse gas footprint) is a ""certain amount of gaseous emissions that are relevant to climate change and associated with human production or consumption activities"""
"In some cases, the carbon footprint is expressed as the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) which is meant to sum up the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, service, place or product"
"In other cases, only the carbon dioxide emissions are taken into account but not those of other greenhouse gases"
"Greenhouse gases, including the carbon-containing gases carbon dioxide and methane, can be emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, land clearance, and the production and consumption of food, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other services"
"As well as calculating carbon footprints for whole countries, it is also possible to calculate the footprint of regions, cities, and neighbourhoods.The global average annual carbon footprint per person in 2014 was about 5 tonnes CO2e"
The average carbon footprint for a U.S
citizen is 16 tons
"This is one of the highest rates in the world.The use of household carbon footprint calculators originated when oil producer BP hired Ogilvy, an advertising agency, to create a marketing campaign in 2005"
"Critics have described this as ""effective propaganda"", arguing that the aim was to shift responsibility of climate change-causing pollution away from the corporations and institutions and onto personal lifestyle choices.


== Definitions ==
The IPCC uses the following definition for carbon footprint: ""Measure of the exclusive total amount of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) that is directly and indirectly caused by an activity or is accumulated over the lifecycle stages of a product."" They chose to adopt the same definition that had been proposed in 2007 by two scientists from the UK"
"Those scientists had pointed out that there was no clear definition of the term yet.In this definition, only carbon dioxide is included in the analysis, rather than the carbon dioxide equivalents which would factor in other greenhouse gases as well"
Their reasoning for not included other greenhouse gases was that those are more difficult to quantify
An inclusion of all greenhouse gases would also make the carbon footprint indicator less practical.Some organizations use the term greenhouse gas footprint or climate footprint when all greenhouse gases are included via their global warming potential (or carbon dioxide equivalents)
"However, it is also common to understand carbon footprint in the same way, i.e"
"for all the greenhouse gases, not just for carbon dioxide"
"== Related concepts ==


=== Ecological footprint ===
The concept and name of the carbon footprint was derived from the ecological footprint concept"
"While carbon footprints are usually reported in tons of emissions (CO2-equivalent) per year, ecological footprints are usually reported in comparison to what the planet can renew"
"This assesses the number of ""earths"" that would be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint"
The carbon footprint is one part of the ecological footprint
"Carbon footprints are more focused than ecological footprints since they merely measure emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere.Carbon footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators, which also include ecological footprints, water footprints and land footprints.


=== Carbon accounting ===


=== Greenhouse gas emissions ===


== Calculations ==

A product, service, or company's carbon footprint can be affected by several factors including, but not limited to:

Energy sources
Offsite electricity generation
MaterialsThese factors can also change with location or industry.
In most cases, the total carbon footprint cannot be calculated exactly because of inadequate knowledge of data about the complex interactions between contributing processes, including the influence of natural processes that store or release carbon dioxide"
"For this reason, Wright, Kemp, and Williams proposed the following definition of a carbon footprint:

A measure of the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions of a defined population, system or activity, considering all relevant sources, sinks and storage within the spatial and temporal boundary of the population, system or activity of interest"
"Calculated as carbon dioxide equivalent using the relevant 100-year global warming potential (GWP100).
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol has extended the range of gases"
"The standard covers the accounting and reporting of seven greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PCFs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
An individual's, nation's, or organization's carbon footprint can be measured by undertaking a GHG emissions assessment, a life cycle assessment, or other calculative activities denoted as carbon accounting"
"Once the size of a carbon footprint is known, a strategy can be devised to reduce it, for example, by technological developments, energy efficiency improvements, better process and product management, changed Green Public or Private Procurement (GPP), carbon capture, consumption strategies, carbon offsetting and others.For calculating personal carbon footprints, several free online carbon footprint calculators exist.Calculating the carbon footprint of industry, product, or service is a complex task"
"One tool industry uses Life-cycle assessment (LCA), where carbon footprint may be one of many factors taken into consideration when assessing a product or service"
The International Organization for Standardization has a standard called ISO 14040:2006 that has the framework for conducting an LCA study
"ISO 14060 family of standards provides further sophisticated tools for quantifying, monitoring, reporting and validating or verifying of GHG emissions and removals"
"Another method is through the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a set of standards for tracking greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) across scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions within the value chain.Predicting the carbon footprint of a process is also possible through estimations using the above standards"
"By using Emission intensities/Carbon intensities and the estimated annual use of fuel, chemical, or other inputs, the carbon footprint can be determined while a process is being planned/designed.


=== Direct carbon emissions ===
Direct or 'scope 1' carbon emissions come from sources that are directly from the site that is producing a product or delivering a service"
An example for industry would be the emissions related to burning a fuel on site
"On the individual level, emissions from personal vehicles or gas burning stoves would fall under scope 1.


=== Indirect carbon emissions ===

Indirect carbon emissions are emissions from sources upstream or downstream from the process being studied, also known as scope 2 or scope 3 emissions.Examples of upstream, indirect carbon emissions may include:
Transportation of materials/fuels
Any energy used outside of the production facility
Wastes produced outside of the production facilityExamples of downstream, indirect carbon emissions may include:
Any end-of-life process or treatments
Product and waste transportation
Emissions associated with selling the productScope 2 emissions are the other indirect related to purchased electricity, heat, and/or steam used on site.Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions derived from the activities of an organization but from sources which they do not own or control"
"The GHG Protocol's Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard allows companies to assess their entire value chain emissions impact and identify where to focus reduction activities.


== By country ==

According to The World Bank, the global average carbon footprint in 2014 was 4.97 metric tons CO2 per person"
"The EU average for 2007 was about 13.8 tons CO2e per person, whereas for the U.S., Luxembourg and Australia it was over 25 tons CO2e per person"
"In 2017, the average for the USA was about 20 metric tons CO2e per person.
The footprints per capita of countries in Africa and India were well below average"
"To set these numbers into context, assuming a global population around 9–10 billion by 2050 a carbon footprint of about 2–2.5 tons CO2e per capita is needed to stay within a 2 °C target"
"The carbon footprint calculations are based on a consumption based approach using a Multi-Regional Input-Output database, which accounts for all  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the global supply chain and allocates them to the final consumer of the purchased commodities"
"GHG emissions related to land use cover change are not included.


== By sector ==


== By products ==

Several organizations offer footprint calculators for public and corporate use, and several organizations have calculated carbon footprints of products.The Carbon Trust has worked with UK manufacturers on foods, shirts and detergents, introducing a CO2 label in March 2007"
The label is intended to comply with a new British Publicly Available Specification (i.e
"not a standard), PAS 2050, and is being actively piloted by The Carbon Trust and various industrial partners"
"As of August 2012 The Carbon Trust state they have measured 27,000 certifiable product carbon footprints.Food contributes 10-30% of a household’s carbon footprint, mainly attributed to agricultural practices like food production and transportation"
"Meat products have larger carbon footprints than plant products like vegetables and grains due to inefficient conversion of plant energy to animals, and the release of methane from manure.The precise carbon footprint of different textiles varies considerably according to a wide range of factors"
"Accounting for durability and energy required to wash and dry textile products, synthetic fabrics generally have a substantially lower carbon footprint than natural ones.The carbon footprint of materials (also known as embodied carbon) varies widely"
"The carbon footprint of many common materials can be found in the Inventory of Carbon & Energy database, the GREET databases and models, and LCA databases via openLCA Nexus"
"The carbon footprint of any manufactured product should be verified by a third-party.


== Critique ==

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term ""carbon footprint"" was first used in a BBC vegetarian food magazine in 1999, though the broader concept of ""environmental footprint"" had been used since at least 1979"
"The idea of a personal carbon footprint was popularized by a large advertising campaign of the fossil fuel company BP in 2005, designed by Ogilvy"
"It instructed people to calculate their personal footprints and provided ways for people to ""go on a low-carbon diet"".This strategy, also employed by other major fossil fuel companies, is now being criticized for trying to shift the blame for negative consequences of those industries onto individual choices"
"Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University have argued that concepts such as carbon footprints ""hamstring us, and they put blinders on us, to the systemic nature of the climate crisis and the importance of taking collective action to address the problem"".Others see the concept more positively"
"Hiroko Tabuchi, climate correspondent of The New York Times, argues that it is ""still a useful concept, though"
"It allows us to see that the carbon footprint of a typical American is many times that of a resident of the Global South"", encourages comparisions between individuals, companies, and countries, and reminds people that ""individual actions do matter"".The strategy has had some success, with a rise in consumers concerned about their own personal actions, and creation of multiple carbon footprint calculators.


== Reducing carbon footprints ==


=== Global perspective ===
The latest climate science is published in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report"
The report presents key scientific findings linking the increase in anthropogenic GHGs emissions in current climate change
"According to the report, it is only possible to avoid warming of 1.5 °C or 2 °C if massive and immediate cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are made"
"This is part of climate change mitigation measures.


=== Ways to reduce personal carbon footprint ===


=== Ways to reduce industry's carbon footprint ===

Reforestation, the restocking of existing forests or woodlands that have previously been depleted, is an example of Carbon Offsetting, the counteracting of carbon dioxide emissions with an equivalent reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere"
"Carbon offsetting can reduce a companies overall carbon footprint by offering a carbon credit.
Supply chain emissions (scope 3) are on average 11.4 times higher than operational emissions, more than double previous estimates, due to suppliers improving their emissions accounting"
"Therefore, there is an increasing focus on companies reducing their emissions coming from their suppliers as a way to reduce risks and capture opportunities.
A life cycle or supply chain carbon footprint study can provide useful data which will help the business to identify specific and critical areas for improvement"
By calculating or predicting a process’ carbon footprint high emissions areas can be identified and steps can be taken to reduce in those areas
"Collecting real data from suppliers emissions, setting a strategy focused on hot-spots and incentivizing suppliers are still barriers for companies"
"Nevertheless, solutions exist and the focus should be on improving year-on-year.
