Sentence
"Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding"
"The game occurs over the course of several plays, with each play generally beginning when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team, called the batter, tries to hit with a bat"
"The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called ""runs"""
"The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases"
"A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).
The principal objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely; this generally occurs either when the batter hits the ball and reaches first base before an opponent retrieves the ball and touches the base, or when the pitcher persists in throwing the ball out of the batter's reach"
"Players on the batting team who reach first base without being called ""out"" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting"
"The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners ""out"", which forces them out of the field of play"
"The pitcher can get the batter out by throwing three pitches which result in strikes, while fielders can get the batter out by catching a batted ball before it touches the ground, and can get a runner out by tagging them with the ball while the runner is not touching a base.
The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs"
One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning
"A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins"
"Most games end after the ninth inning, but if scores are tied at that point, extra innings are usually played"
"Baseball has no game clock, though some competitions feature pace-of-play regulations such as the pitch clock to shorten game time.
Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century"
"This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed"
"Baseball's American origins, as well as its reputation as a source of escapism during troubled points in American history such as the American Civil War and the Great Depression, have led the sport to receive the moniker of ""America's Pastime""; since the late 19th century, it has been unofficially recognized as the national sport of the United States, though in modern times is considered less popular than other sports, such as American football"
"In addition to North America, baseball is considered the most popular sport in parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
In Major League Baseball (MLB), the highest level of professional baseball in the United States and Canada, teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central"
The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series
The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League
"The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world"
"Baseball was played at the Olympic Games from 1992 to 2008, and was reinstated in 2020.


== Rules and gameplay ==

A baseball game is played between two teams, each usually composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding)"
"A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an inning"
"A game consists of nine innings (seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college, Minor League Baseball and, since the 2020 season, Major League Baseball; and six innings at the Little League level)"
"One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning"
"The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning"
The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team
"The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped baseball diamond"
"A player bats at home plate and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, counterclockwise, from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run"
"The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again"
"When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning"
"If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest"
"Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles"
The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory
The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield
"In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center"
"The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height"
"The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.There are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt:

The baseball is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9 inches (23 centimeters) in circumference"
"It has a rubber or cork center, wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide, with red stitching.
The bat is a hitting tool, traditionally made of a single, solid piece of wood"
Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games
"It is a hard round stick, about 2.5 inches (6.4 centimeters) in diameter at the hitting end, tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob"
"Bats used by adults are typically around 34 inches (86 centimeters) long, and not longer than 42 inches (110 centimeters).
The glove or mitt is a fielding tool, made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers"
"As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball, it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions.Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.At the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players of the fielding team arrange themselves around the field"
"One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound"
"The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate"
"Another fielding team player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher"
"The rest of the fielding team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders"
"In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base"
"The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder"
"With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory when the pitch is delivered"
A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher
"Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well.

Play starts with a member of the batting team, the batter, standing in either of the two batter's boxes next to home plate, holding a bat"
"The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with the bat"
The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher
"A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner)"
A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to be safe and is on base
A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely
A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit
A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single
"If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple"
"If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or if the batter-runner otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run"
This is the most desirable result for the batter
"The ultimate and most desirable result possible for a batter would be to hit a home run while all three bases are occupied or ""loaded"", thus scoring four runs on a single hit"
This is called a grand slam
"A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands"
"A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play, as only one runner may occupy a base at any given time"
"If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they occupied when the play began"
"If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after the ball is caught)"
Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a stolen base.A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball
A batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out
"A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base"
"(A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee"
"Any pitch which does not pass through the strike zone is called a ball, unless the batter either swings and misses at the pitch, or hits the pitch into foul territory; an exception generally occurs if the ball is hit into foul territory when the batter already has two strikes, in which case neither a ball nor a strike is called.

While the team at bat is trying to score runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs"
"In addition to the strikeout and flyout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out include the ground out, force out, and tag out"
"These occur either when a runner is forced to advance to a base, and a fielder with possession of the ball reaches that base before the runner does, or the runner is touched by the ball, held in a fielder's hand, while not on a base"
"(The batter-runner is always forced to advance to first base, and any other runners must advance to the next base if a teammate is forced to advance to their base.) It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play"
This is called a double play
"Three outs in one play, a triple play, is possible, though rare"
"Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench"
A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team
"Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty.An individual player's turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base, hits a home run, makes an out, or hits a ball that results in the team's third out, even if it is recorded against a teammate"
"On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate—for instance, a runner getting caught stealing (tagged out attempting to steal a base)"
A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased
A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn
"Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat in the batting order"
"The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions"
"Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game"
"Children's games often have more lenient rules, such as Little League rules, which allow players to be substituted back into the same game.If the designated hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat (and run)"
"The DH takes the place of another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field"
"Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.


== Personnel ==


=== Players ===

The number of players on a baseball roster, or squad, varies by league and by the level of organized play"
A Major League Baseball (MLB) team has a roster of 25 players with specific roles
"A typical roster features the following players:
Eight position players: the catcher, four infielders, and three outfielders—all of whom play on a regular basis
Five starting pitchers who constitute the team's pitching rotation or starting rotation
Six relief pitchers, including one closer, who constitute the team's bullpen (named for the off-field area where pitchers warm up)
One backup, or substitute, catcher
Two backup infielders
Two backup outfielders
One pinch hitter, or a utility player, or a seventh relieverMost baseball leagues worldwide have the DH rule, including the MLB, Japan's Pacific League, and Caribbean professional leagues, along with major American amateur organizations"
The Central League in Japan does not have the rule and high-level minor league clubs connected to National League teams are not required to field a DH
"In leagues that apply the designated hitter rule, a typical team has nine offensive regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher, and two or three other reserve players.


=== Managers and coaches ===
The manager, or head coach, oversees the team's major strategic decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers"
"Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning"
"At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, who occupy designated coaches' boxes, just outside the foul lines"
"These coaches assist in the direction of baserunners, when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners, during pauses in play"
"In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game.


=== Umpires ===
Any baseball game involves one or more umpires, who make rulings on the outcome of each play"
"At a minimum, one umpire will stand behind the catcher, to have a good view of the strike zone, and call balls and strikes"
"Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases, thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs"
"In MLB, four umpires are used for each game, one near each base"
"In the playoffs, six umpires are used: one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines.


== Strategy ==

Many of the pre-game and in-game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact: in general, right-handed batters tend to be more successful against left-handed pitchers and, to an even greater degree, left-handed batters tend to be more successful against right-handed pitchers"
"A manager with several left-handed batters in the regular lineup, who knows the team will be facing a left-handed starting pitcher, may respond by starting one or more of the right-handed backups on the team's roster"
"During the late innings of a game, as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in, the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions"
The manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same-handed pitcher-batter matchups and the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite-handed matchups
"With a team that has the lead in the late innings, a manager may remove a starting position player—especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again—for a more skillful fielder (known as a defensive substitution).


== Tactics ==


=== Pitching and fielding ===

The tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection"
"By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter, thus creating differing pitches that can be selected"
"Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider"
Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing
"Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, as well as its general vertical and/or horizontal location"
"If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch.
With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out"
"Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt"
"Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, which permits any runners on base to advance one base with impunity"
"If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base"
"Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions"
"With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.


=== Batting and baserunning ===
Several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base, including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base"
"The hit and run is sometimes employed, with a skillful contact hitter, the runner takes off with the pitch, drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base, creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through"
"The sacrifice bunt, calls for the batter to focus on making soft contact with the ball, so that it rolls a short distance into the infield, allowing the runner to advance into scoring position as the batter is thrown out at first"
"A batter, particularly one who is a fast runner, may also attempt to bunt for a hit"
"A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base, aimed at bringing that runner home, is known as a squeeze play"
"With a runner on third and fewer than two outs, a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that, even if it is caught, will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score—a successful batter, in this case, gets credit for a sacrifice fly"
"In order to increase the chance of advancing a batter to first base via a walk, the manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count (i.e., has more balls than strikes) to take, or not swing at, the next pitch"
"The batter's potential reward of reaching base (via a walk) exceeds the disadvantage if the next pitch is a strike.


== History ==

The evolution of baseball from older bat-and-ball games is difficult to trace with precision"
"Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular among children in Great Britain and Ireland"
American baseball historian David Block suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position
"Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and ""tut-ball"""
"The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication, A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, by John Newbery"
"Block discovered that the first recorded game of ""Bass-Ball"" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player"
"This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants.By the early 1830s, there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat-and-ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America"
"The first officially recorded baseball game in North America was played in Beachville, Ontario, Canada, on June 4, 1838"
"In 1845, Alexander Cartwright, a member of New York City's Knickerbocker Club, led the codification of the so-called Knickerbocker Rules, which in turn were based on rules developed in 1837 by William R"
Wheaton of the Gotham Club
"While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S"
"history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the ""New York Nine"" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings"
"With the Knickerbocker code as the basis, the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half-century"
"By the time of the Civil War, baseball had begun to overtake its fellow bat-and-ball sport cricket in popularity within the United States, due in part to baseball being of a much shorter duration than the form of cricket played at the time, as well as the fact that troops during the Civil War did not need a specialized playing surface to play baseball, as they would have required for cricket.


=== In the United States ===


==== Establishment of professional leagues ====
In the mid-1850s, a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area, and by 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the ""national pastime"" or ""national game"""
"A year later, the sport's first governing body, the National Association of Base Ball Players, was formed"
"In 1867, it barred participation by African Americans"
The more formally structured National League was founded in 1876
"Professional Negro leagues formed, but quickly folded"
"In 1887, softball, under the name of indoor baseball or indoor-outdoor, was invented as a winter version of the parent game"
"The National League's first successful counterpart, the American League, which evolved from the minor Western League, was established in 1893, and virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by then.The National Agreement of 1903 formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues"
"The World Series, pitting the two major league champions against each other, was inaugurated that fall"
 The Black Sox Scandal of the 1919 World Series led to the formation of the office of the Commissioner of Baseball
"The first commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920"
"That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931"
"For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.


==== Rise of Ruth and racial integration ====
Compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers were more dominant"
The so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters
"Strict new regulations governed the ball's size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit"
"The rise of the legendary player Babe Ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game"
"In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St"
Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern farm system
"A new Negro National League was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the Negro American League"
The first elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame took place in 1936
"In 1939, Little League Baseball was founded in Pennsylvania.

A large number of minor league teams disbanded when World War II led to a player shortage"
Chicago Cubs owner Philip K
Wrigley led the formation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League to help keep the game in the public eye
The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred in 1945: Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League's Brooklyn Dodgers and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal
"In 1947, Robinson broke the major leagues' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers"
"Latin-American players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers"
"In 1951, two Chicago White Sox, Venezuelan-born Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban-born Minnie Miñoso, became the first Hispanic All-Stars"
"Integration proceeded slowly: by 1953, only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster.


==== Attendance records and the age of steroids ====
In 1975, the union's power—and players' salaries—began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down, leading to the free agency system"
"Significant work stoppages occurred in 1981 and 1994, the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years"
"Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid-1970s and in 1994, before the stoppage, the majors were setting their all-time record for per-game attendance"
"After play resumed in 1995, non-division-winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post-season"
Regular-season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second-highest attendance mark for a full season was set
"In 2000, the National and American Leagues were dissolved as legal entities"
"While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes (and the designated hitter distinction), the regulations and other functions—such as player discipline and umpire supervision—they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of MLB.In 2001, Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season"
"There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004"
"In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.


=== Around the world ===
With the historic popular moniker as ""America's national pastime"", baseball is well established in several other countries as well"
"As early as 1877, a professional league, the International Association, featured teams from both Canada and the US"
"While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969, when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team"
"In 1977, the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League.

In 1847, American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los Berros in Xalapa, Veracruz"
"The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition"
The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912
"Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the Netherlands (formed in 1922), Australia (1934), Japan (1936), Mexico (1937), and Puerto Rico (1938)"
"The Japanese major leagues have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States.

After World War II, professional leagues were founded in many Latin American countries, most prominently Venezuela (1946) and the Dominican Republic (1955)"
"Since the early 1970s, the annual Caribbean Series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues: the Dominican Professional Baseball League, Mexican Pacific League, Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League, and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League"
"In Asia, South Korea (1982), Taiwan (1990) and China (2003) all have professional leagues.The English football club, Aston Villa, were the first British baseball champions winning the 1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain"
The 2020 National Champions were the London Mets
"Other European countries have seen professional leagues; the most successful, other than the Dutch league, is the Italian league, founded in 1948"
"In 2004, Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games"
"The Confédération Européene de Baseball (European Baseball Confederation), founded in 1953, organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries"
"Other competitions between national teams, such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament, were administered by the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC)"
" Women's baseball is played on an organized amateur basis in numerous countries.After being admitted to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting"
It remained part of the 2008 Games
"While the sport's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was MLB's reluctance to allow its players to participate during the major league season"
"MLB initiated the World Baseball Classic, scheduled to precede its season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament"
"The inaugural Classic, held in March 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants"
"The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic.


== Distinctive elements ==
Baseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following"
"All of these sports use a clock, play is less individual, and the variation between playing fields is not as substantial or important"
"The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.


=== No clock to kill ===

In clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team"
"In contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time"
"At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy"
"Whereas, in the case of multi-day Test and first-class cricket, the possibility of a draw (which occurs because of the restrictions on time, which like in baseball, originally did not exist) often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind, to bat defensively and run out the clock, giving up any faint chance at a win, to avoid an overall loss.While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years"
"At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play"
"In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960"
"By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters)"
"In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45"
"By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete"
"The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play, with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently"
Other leagues have experienced similar issues
"In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.In 2016, the average nine-inning playoff game in Major League baseball was 3 hours and 35 minutes"
This was up 10 minutes from 2015 and 21 minutes from 2014
"In response to the lengthening of the game, MLB decided from the 2023 season onward to institute a pitch clock rule to penalize batters and pitchers who take too much time between pitches.


=== Individual focus ===

Although baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure"
"While rewarding, it has sometimes been described as ""ruthless"" due to the pressure on the individual player"
"In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: ""the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits"""
"Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other"
"While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts"
"If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing"
"The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it.
Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more"
"There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.


=== Uniqueness of parks ===

Unlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape"
"While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of MLB and Minor League Baseball, is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of 325 feet (99 m) from home plate to the fences in left and right field and 400 feet (122 m) to center"
Major league teams often skirt even this rule
"For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only 315 feet (96 m) from home plate"
There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield
"The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's Fenway Park, in use since 1912: the Green Monster is 310 feet (94 m) from home plate down the line and 37 feet (11 m) tall.Similarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory"
"Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground"
"A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner"
These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run
The surface of the field is also unregulated
"While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare"
"Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf"
Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning
"Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played"
"While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized"
"The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.

These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark"
"Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play"
"A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements"
"The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies"
"Its high altitude—5,282 feet (1,610 m) above sea level—is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure"
"Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a pitcher's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing in, it becomes more of a hitter's park when they are blowing out"
"The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records"
"For example, hitting a fly ball 330 feet (100 m) into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another"
"A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it"
"On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.


== Statistics ==

Organized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports"
Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes
"In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, was responsible for the ""development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball."" The statistical record is so central to the game's ""historical essence"" that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball"
"In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian Alan Schwarz describes as a ""tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.""The Official Baseball Rules administered by MLB require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously"
The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency
The score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records
"General managers, managers, and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions.

Certain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans"
"The basic batting statistics include:
At bats: plate appearances, excluding walks and hit by pitches—where the batter's ability is not fully tested—and sacrifices and sacrifice flies—where the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners
Hits: times a base is reached safely, because of a batted, fair ball without a fielding error or fielder's choice
Runs: times circling the bases and reaching home safely
Runs batted in (RBIs): number of runners who scored due to a batter's action (including the batter, in the case of a home run), except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error
Home runs: hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases, without the contribution of a fielding error
Batting average: hits divided by at bats—the traditional measure of batting abilityThe basic baserunning statistics include:
Stolen bases: times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner's own efforts, generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball
Caught stealing: times tagged out while attempting to steal a base
The basic pitching statistics include:
Wins: credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished (a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win)
Losses: charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished
Saves: games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher's team, finishes the game without surrendering the lead, is not the winning pitcher, and either (a) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game; (b) the potential tying run was on base, at bat, or on deck; or (c) the pitcher pitched three or more innings
Innings pitched: outs recorded while pitching divided by three (partial innings are conventionally recorded as, e.g., ""5.2"" or ""7.1"", the last digit actually representing thirds, not tenths, of an inning)
Strikeouts: times pitching three strikes to a batter
Winning percentage: wins divided by decisions (wins plus losses)
Earned run average (ERA): runs allowed, excluding those resulting from fielding errors, per nine innings pitchedThe basic fielding statistics include:
Putouts: times the fielder catches a fly ball, tags or forces out a runner, or otherwise directly effects an out
Assists: times a putout by another fielder was recorded following the fielder touching the ball
Errors: times the fielder fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort, and the batting team benefits as a result
Total chances: putouts plus assists plus errors
Fielding average: successful chances (putouts plus assists) divided by total chancesAmong the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics"
"For example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against"
"If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.


=== Sabermetrics ===
Sabermetrics refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools"
The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves
"The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, Bill James, and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR).The growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:
On-base percentage (OBP) measures a batter's ability to get on base"
"It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts.
Slugging percentage (SLG) measures a batter's ability to hit for power"
"It is calculated by taking the batter's total bases (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four per home run) and dividing that by the batter's at bats.Some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:

On-base plus slugging (OPS) measures a batter's overall ability"
"It is calculated by adding the batter's on-base percentage and slugging percentage.
Walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) measures a pitcher's ability at preventing hitters from reaching base"
"It is calculated by adding the number of walks and hits a pitcher surrendered, then dividing by the number of innings pitched.
Wins Above Replacement (WAR) measures number of additional wins his team has achieved above the number of expected team wins if that player were substituted with a replacement-level player.


== Popularity and cultural impact ==

Writing in 1919, philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as the national religion of the US"
"In the words of sports columnist Jayson Stark, baseball has long been ""a unique paragon of American culture""—a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal"
"Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well: Scholar Peter Bjarkman describes ""how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba, [and] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and nativized in Japan.""


=== In the United States ===
The major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience"
"A century later, the situation was very different"
"With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.

Overall, baseball has a large following in the United States; a 2006 poll found that nearly half of Americans are fans"
"In the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseball's position compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions"
"In 2008, MLB set a revenue record of $6.5 billion, matching the NFL's revenue for the first time in decades"
A new MLB revenue record of more than $10 billion was set in 2017
"On the other hand, the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 9%, compared to pro football at 37%"
"In 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%"
"Because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance"
"In 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6 million, 0.7% off the record set the previous year"
"The following year, amid the U.S"
"recession, attendance fell by 6.6% to 73.4 million"
"Eight years later, it dropped under 73 million"
"Attendance at games held under the Minor League Baseball umbrella set a record in 2008, with 43.3 million"
"While MLB games have not drawn the same national TV viewership as football games, MLB games are dominant in teams' local markets and regularly lead all programs in primetime in their markets during the summer.


=== Caribbean ===
Since the early 1980s, the Dominican Republic, in particular the city of San Pedro de Macorís, has been the major leagues' primary source of foreign talent"
"In 2017, 83 of the 868 players on MLB Opening Day rosters (and disabled lists) were from the country"
"Among other Caribbean countries and territories, a combined 97 MLB players were born in Venezuela, Cuba, and Puerto Rico"
Hall-of-Famer Roberto Clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in Puerto Rico's history
"While baseball has long been the island's primary athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990, when young Puerto Rican players began to be included in the major leagues' annual first-year player draft"
"In Cuba, where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport, the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top-level domestic leagues.


=== Asia ===

In Asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in Japan and South Korea"
"In Japan, where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport, combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific Leagues, was estimated at $1 billion in 2007"
Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million
"While in the preceding two decades, MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled, the comparable NPB figures were stagnant"
There are concerns that MLB's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country
Revenue figures are not released for the country's amateur system
"Similarly, according to one official pronouncement, the sport's governing authority ""has never taken into account attendance .."
"because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes"""
"In Taiwan, baseball is one of the most widely spectated sports, with the origins dating back to Japanese rule.


=== Among children ===
As of 2018, Little League Baseball oversees leagues with close to 2.4 million participants in over 80 countries"
"The number of players has fallen since the 1990s, when 3 million children took part in Little League Baseball annually"
Babe Ruth League teams have over 1 million participants
"According to the president of the International Baseball Federation, between 300,000 and 500,000 women and girls play baseball around the world, including Little League and the introductory game of Tee Ball.A varsity baseball team is an established part of physical education departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States"
"In 2015, nearly half a million high schoolers and over 34,000 collegians played on their schools' baseball teams"
"By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport"
"Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there"
"The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country"
"The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played"
"In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six"
"Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.


=== In popular culture ===

Baseball has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere"
"Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual euphemisms"
"The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts"
"The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.Baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment"
"One of the first major examples, Ernest Thayer's poem ""Casey at the Bat"", appeared in 1888"
"A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a ""clutch situation"", the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances, audio recordings, film adaptations, and an opera, as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media"
"There have been many baseball movies, including the Academy Award–winning The Pride of the Yankees (1942) and the Oscar nominees The Natural (1984) and Field of Dreams (1989)"
The American Film Institute's selection of the ten best sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham (1988) at number 5
Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage—the Adler–Ross musical Damn Yankees—and record—George J
"Gaskin's ""Slide, Kelly, Slide"", Simon and Garfunkel's ""Mrs"
"Robinson"", and John Fogerty's ""Centerfield"""
"The baseball-inspired comedic sketch ""Who's on First?"", popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938, quickly became famous"
"Six decades later, Time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century.Literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud's The Natural (the source for the movie), Robert Coover's The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J"
"Henry Waugh, Prop., John Grisham's Calico Joe and W"
P
Kinsella's Shoeless Joe (the source for Field of Dreams)
"Baseball's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon; the columns of Grantland Rice, Red Smith, Dick Young, and Peter Gammons; and the essays of Roger Angell"
Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are Lawrence S
"Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer, and Michael Lewis's Moneyball"
The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton's tell-all chronicle Ball Four is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports.Baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms
Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards
A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other
In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies
"The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data"
"Baseball cards—many of which are now prized collectibles—are the source of the much broader trading card industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.Modern fantasy sports began in 1980 with the invention of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends"
Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active MLB players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players' latest real-world statistics
Rotisserie-style play quickly became a phenomenon
"Now known more generically as fantasy baseball, it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports"
The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports-related websites
"By 2008, 29.9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports, spending $800 million on the hobby"
"The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics—first among fans, only later among baseball professionals.


=== Derivative games ===
Informal variations of baseball have popped up over time, with games like corkball reflecting local traditions and allowing the game to be played in diverse environments"
"Two variations of baseball, softball and Baseball5, are internationally governed alongside baseball by the World Baseball Softball Confederation.


==== British baseball ====

American professional baseball teams toured Britain in 1874 and 1889, and had a great effect on similar sports in Britain"
"In Wales and Merseyside, a strong community game had already developed with skills and plays more in keeping with the American game and the Welsh began to informally adopt the name ""baseball"" (Pêl Fas), to reflect the American style"
"By the 1890s, calls were made to follow the success of other working class sports (like Rugby in Wales and Soccer in Merseyside) and adopt a distinct set of rules and bureaucracy"
"During the 1892 season rules for the game of ""baseball"" were agreed and the game was officially codified.


==== Finnish baseball ====

Finnish baseball, known as pesäpallo, is a combination of traditional ball-batting team games and North American baseball, invented by Lauri ""Tahko"" Pihkala in the 1920s"
"The basic idea of pesäpallo is similar to that of baseball: the offense tries to score by hitting the ball successfully and running through the bases, while the defense tries to put the batter and runners out"
"One of the most important differences between pesäpallo and baseball is that the ball is pitched vertically, which makes hitting the ball, as well as controlling the power and direction of the hit, much easier"
"This gives the offensive game more variety, speed, and tactical aspects compared to baseball.

"Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal"
" Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used"
"Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America, Ireland and Australia); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football"
"These various forms of football share to varying extents common origins and are known as ""football codes"".
There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world"
Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century
The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire
" By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage"
" In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations"
"During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.


== Common elements ==

The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.Common rules among the sports include:
Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.
A clearly defined area in which to play the game.
Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.
Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.
The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.
Players using only their body to move the ball, i.e"
"no additional equipment such as bats or sticks.In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking"
"In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts.


== Etymology ==

There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word ""football"""
" It is widely assumed that the word ""football"" (or the phrase ""foot ball"") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball"
"There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe that were played on foot"
"There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.


== Early history ==


=== Ancient games ===


==== Ancient China ====

The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠) resembles modern association football"
"It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and third centuries BC, attested by descriptions in a military manual"
"The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period"
This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD
"In kemari, several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie).


==== Ancient Greece and Rome ====
The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet"
"The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as ""ἐπίσκυρος"" (Episkyros) or ""φαινίνδα"" (phaininda), which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c"
150 – c
215 AD)
These games appear to have resembled rugby football
The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop
"Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis"
"Episkyros is described as an early form of football by FIFA.


==== Native Americans ====
There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world"
"For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit in Greenland"
"There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk"
"Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal"
"In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman"
"Pasuckuakohowog, a game similar to modern-day association football played amongst Amerindians, was also reported as early as the 17th century.
Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports"
"Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of ""football.""


==== Oceania ====
On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for ""game ball"")"
"The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: ""Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it."" Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football.
The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Ki-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.These games and others may well go far back into antiquity"
"However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England.


==== Turkic peoples ====
Mahmud al-Kashgari in his Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk, described a game called ""tepuk"" among Turks in Central Asia"
"In the game, people try to attack each other's castle by kicking a ball made of sheep leather.

		
		
		
		
		


=== Medieval and early modern Europe ===

The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England"
"An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th-century Historia Brittonum, attributed to Nennius, which describes ""a party of boys .."
"playing at ball"""
"References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, date from the 12th century.

The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as ""mob football"", would be played in towns or between neighbouring villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse, struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes"
"The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter, and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).
The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183"
"He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:

After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game"
The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls
"Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.
Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of ""ball play"" or ""playing at ball"""
"This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.
An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England:  ""Henry.."
while playing at ball.
"ran against David"""
" Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a ""football game"" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard"
" Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England: ""[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his.."
"ran against him and wounded himself"".In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time"
"A translation reads: ""[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."" This is the earliest reference to football.
In 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning ""...handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games"", showing that ""football"" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.

A game known as ""football"" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906"
"There is evidence for schoolboys playing a ""football"" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball"
"The word ""pass"" in the most recent translation is derived from ""huc percute"" (strike it here) and later ""repercute pilam"" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin"
It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team
"The original word translated as ""goal"" is ""metum"", literally meaning the ""pillar at each end of the circus course"" in a Roman chariot race"
"There is a reference to ""get hold of the ball before [another player] does"" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed"
"One sentence states in the original 1930 translation ""Throw yourself against him"" (Age, objice te illi).
King Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word ""football"", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for ""foteball"".There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire"
"This is the first description of a ""kicking game"" and the first description of dribbling: ""[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game"
"It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet.."
"kicking in opposite directions."" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: ""[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.

Other firsts in the medieval and early modern eras:

""a football"", in the sense of a ball rather than a game, was first mentioned in 1486"
This reference is in Dame Juliana Berners' Book of St Albans
"It states: ""a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal.""
a pair of football boots were ordered by King Henry VIII of England in 1526.
women playing a form of football was first described in 1580 by Sir Philip Sidney in one of his poems: ""[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes.""
the first references to goals are in the late 16th and early 17th centuries"
"In 1584 and 1602 respectively, John Norden and Richard Carew referred to ""goals"" in Cornish hurling"
"Carew described how goals were made: ""they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales"""
"He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players.
the first direct reference to scoring a goal is in John Day's play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (performed circa 1600; published 1659): ""I'll play a gole at camp-ball"" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in East Anglia)"
"Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to ""when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe"".


=== Calcio Fiorentino ===

In the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as ""calcio storico"" (""historic kickball"") in the Piazza Santa Croce"
The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football
"For example, calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents"
Blows below the belt were allowed
The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise
"In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino"
This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game
"The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).


=== Official disapproval and attempts to ban football ===

There have been many attempts to ban football, from the middle ages through to the modern day"
"The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.: 6  Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s"
"Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.
American football also faced pressures to ban the sport"
" The game played in the 19th century resembled mob football that developed in medieval Europe, including a version popular on university campuses known as old division football, and several municipalities banned its play in the mid-19th century"
"By the 20th century, the game had evolved to a more rugby style game"
" In 1905, there were calls to ban American football in the U.S"
"due to its violence; a meeting that year was hosted by American president Theodore Roosevelt led to sweeping rules changes that caused the sport to diverge significantly from its rugby roots to become more like the sport as it is played today.


== Establishment of modern codes ==


=== English public schools ===

While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes"
"First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its ""mob"" form and turning it into an organised team sport"
"Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools"
"Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools"
"Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between ""kicking"" and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games first became clear.
The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519"
"Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase ""We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde"".Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as ""the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football"""
Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football
"Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (""sides"" and ""parties""), positions (""standings""), a referee (""judge over the parties"") and a coach ""(trayning maister)"""
"Mulcaster's ""footeball"" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:

[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously .."
"may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.
In 1633, David Wedderburn, a teacher from Aberdeen, mentioned elements of modern football games in a short Latin textbook called Vocabula"
"Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as ""keeping goal"" and makes an allusion to passing the ball (""strike it here"")"
"There is a reference to ""get hold of the ball"", suggesting that some handling was allowed"
"It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (""drive that man back"").A more detailed description of football is given in Francis Willughby's Book of Games, written in about 1660"
"Willughby, who had studied at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield, is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: ""a close that has a gate at either end"
"The gates are called Goals."" His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field"
"He also mentions tactics (""leaving some of their best players to guard the goal""); scoring (""they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win"") and the way teams were selected (""the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"")"
"He is the first to describe a ""law"" of football: ""they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball"".English public schools were the first to codify football games"
"In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century"
"In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were ""off their side"" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective"
"Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand"
"They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation"
"However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850"
"The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815 and Aldenham in 1825.)
During the early 19th century, most working-class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day"
"They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many children were part of the labour force"
Feast day football played on the streets was in decline
"Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.
Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit"
"Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils"
Two schools of thought developed regarding rules
"Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse)"
The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played
"For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.

William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have ""with a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game."" in 1823"
"This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal"
"The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory, the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.
The boom in rail transport in Britain during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before"
Inter-school sporting competitions became possible
"However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules"
"The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host ""home"" school, and the other half by the visiting ""away"" school.
The modern rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century"
"This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc"
The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first lawnmower in 1830
"This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields"
"However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see Surviving UK school games below).

Public schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the Factory Act of 1850, which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children"
"Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day"
"From 1850, they could not work before 6 a.m"
(7 a.m
in winter) or after 6 p.m
on weekdays (7 p.m
in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2 p.m
"These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.
The earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:

9 December 1834: Eton School v"
"Harrow School.
1840s: Old Rugbeians v"
"Old Salopians (played at Cambridge University).
1840s: Old Rugbeians v"
"Old Salopians (played at Cambridge University the following year).
1852: Harrow School v"
"Westminster School.
1857: Haileybury School v"
"Westminster School.
24 February 1858: Forest School v"
"Chigwell School.
1858: Westminster School v"
"Winchester College.
1859: Harrow School v"
"Westminster School.
19 November 1859: Radley College v"
"Old Wykehamists.
1 December 1859: Old Marlburians v"
"Old Rugbeians (played at Christ Church, Oxford).
19 December 1859: Old Harrovians v"
"Old Wykehamists (played at Christ Church, Oxford).


=== Firsts ===


==== Clubs ====

Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called ""The Foot-Ball Club"" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824–41"
" The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school"
These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football
"This further assisted the spread of the Rugby game.
The earliest known matches involving non-public school clubs or institutions are as follows:

13 February 1856: Charterhouse School v"
"St Bartholemew's Hospital.
7 November 1856: Bedford Grammar School v"
"Bedford Town Gentlemen.
13 December 1856: Sunbury Military College v"
"Littleton Gentlemen.
December 1857: Edinburgh University v"
"Edinburgh Academical Club.
24 November 1858: Westminster School v"
"Dingley Dell Club.
12 May 1859: Tavistock School v"
"Princetown School.
5 November 1859: Eton School v"
"Oxford University.
22 February 1860: Charterhouse School v"
"Dingley Dell Club.
21 July 1860: Melbourne v"
"Richmond.
17 December 1860: 58th Regiment v"
"Sheffield.
26 December 1860: Sheffield v"
"Hallam.


==== Competitions ====

One of the longest running football fixture is the Cordner-Eggleston Cup, contested between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne every year since 1858"
"It is believed by many to also be the first match of Australian rules football, although it was played under experimental rules in its first year"
"The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne, played in 1861 under the Melbourne Rules"
" The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, the United Hospitals Challenge Cup (1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is the Yorkshire Cup, contested since 1878"
The South Australian Football Association (30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition
The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the Youdan Cup (1867) and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup (1871)
The Football League (1888) is recognised as the longest running association football league
The first international football match took place between sides representing England and Scotland on 5 March 1870 at the Oval under the authority of the FA
"The first rugby international took place in 1871.


==== Modern balls ====

 
In Europe, early footballs were made out of animal bladders, more specifically pig's bladders, which were inflated"
Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape
"However, in 1851, Richard Lindon and William Gilbert, both shoemakers from the town of Rugby (near the school), exhibited both round and oval-shaped balls at the Great Exhibition in London"
Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders
"Lindon also won medals for the invention of the ""Rubber inflatable Bladder"" and the ""Brass Hand Pump"".
In 1855, the U.S"
"inventor Charles Goodyear – who had patented vulcanised rubber – exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at the Paris Exhibition Universelle"
"The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.S.The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (see truncated icosahedron) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cup in 1970.


==== Modern ball passing tactics ====

The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in Aberdeen, Scotland"
"Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time).""Scientific"" football is first recorded in 1839 from Lancashire and in the modern game in rugby football from 1862 and from Sheffield FC as early as 1865"
 The first side to play a passing combination game was the Royal Engineers AFC in 1869/70
"By 1869 they were ""work[ing] well together"", ""backing up"" and benefiting from ""cooperation"""
"By 1870 the Engineers were passing the ball: ""Lieut"
"Creswell, who having brought the ball up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called"""
Passing was a regular feature of their style
"By early 1872 the Engineers were the first football team renowned for ""play[ing] beautifully together"""
"A double pass is first reported from Derby school against Nottingham Forest in March 1872, the first of which is irrefutably a short pass: ""Mr Absey dribbling the ball half the length of the field delivered it to Wallis, who kicking it cleverly in front of the goal, sent it to the captain who drove it at once between the Nottingham posts"""
"The first side to have perfected the modern formation was Cambridge University AFC; they also introduced the 2–3–5 ""pyramid"" formation.


=== Rugby football ===

Rugby football was thought to have been started about 1845 at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, England although forms of football in which the ball was carried and tossed date to medieval times"
"In Britain, by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game"
"There were also ""rugby"" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand"
"However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU)"
The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871
These rules allowed passing the ball
"They also included the try, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest"
"Regardless of any form of football, the first international match between the national team of England and Scotland took place at Raeburn Place on 27 March 1871.
Rugby football split into Rugby union, Rugby league, American football, and Canadian football"
"Tom Wills played Rugby football in England before founding Australian rules football.


=== Cambridge rules ===

During the nineteenth century, several codifications of the rules of football were made at the University of Cambridge, in order to enable students from different public schools to play each other"
"The Cambridge Rules of 1863 influenced the decision of the Football Association to ban Rugby-style carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws.


=== Sheffield rules ===

By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football"
"Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.
However, the club initially played its own code of football: the Sheffield rules"
"The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule.
The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football"
"These included free kicks, corner kicks, handball, throw-ins and the crossbar"
By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England
"At this time, a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877.


=== Australian rules football ===

There is archival evidence of ""foot-ball"" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century"
"The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria.
In July 1858, Tom Wills, an Australian-born cricketer educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling for a ""foot-ball club"" with a ""code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during winter"
This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football
"Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules, the first of which was played on 31 July 1858"
"One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College"
"Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.

Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859"
"Club members Wills, William Hammersley, J"
B
Thompson and Thomas H
Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs
The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling
"The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions"
H
C
A
"Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted ""a game of our own"""
"The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball.
The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs"
The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs
A significant redraft in 1866 by H
C
A
"Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as ""Victorian Rules"" increasingly distinct from other codes"
"It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking"
The game spread quickly to other Australian colonies
"Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world, and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition.


=== The Football Association ===

During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games"
"In 1862, J"
C
"Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at Uppingham School, and he issued his own rules of what he called ""The Simplest Game"" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules)"
"In early October 1863, another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.
At the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of the Football Association (FA)"
The aim of the association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members
"Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association"
"All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham"
"In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863"
"After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published"
"However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863"
The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins)
"The two contentious FA rules were as follows:

IX"
"A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.
X"
"If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.
At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed"
"Most of the delegates supported this, but F"
M
"Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected"
"He said: ""hacking is the true football"""
"However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA"
"After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the ""Laws of the Game"", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football"
"The term ""soccer"", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of ""association"".The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a mark, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal, from 15 yards (13.5 metres) in front of the goal line.


=== North American football codes ===

As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students"
"For example, students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire played a game called Old division football, a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s"
"They remained largely ""mob football"" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary"
"Rules were simple, violence and injury were common"
The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them
"Yale University, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard University followed suit in 1861"
"In its place, two general types of football evolved: ""kicking"" games and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games"
"A hybrid of the two, known as the ""Boston game"", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club"
"The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the Boston game on Boston Common"
The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s
"The universities of Yale, Princeton (then known as the College of New Jersey), Rutgers, and Brown all began playing ""kicking"" games during this time"
"In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English Football Association.

In Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on 9 November 1861, at University College, University of Toronto (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park)"
"One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school"
" In 1864, at Trinity College, Toronto, F"
"Barlow Cumberland, Frederick A"
"Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on rugby football"
"A ""running game"", resembling rugby football, was then taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868.

On 6 November 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules"
"It is usually regarded as the first game of American intercollegiate football.

Modern North American football grew out of a match between McGill University of Montreal and Harvard University in 1874"
"During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard"
"Within a few years, Harvard had both adopted McGill's rules and persuaded other U.S"
university teams to do the same
"On 23 November 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit Convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, agreeing to adopt most of the Rugby Football Union rules, with some variations.In 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp, who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations"
Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the down-and-distance rules
American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death
This led U.S
"President Theodore Roosevelt to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes"
"One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass"
"Though it was underutilised for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game"
"In 1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules, which implemented the line of scrimmage and down-and-distance system from American football, among others"
Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929
"American and Canadian football remain different codes, stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not.


=== Gaelic football ===

In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as caid, remained popular in Ireland, especially in County Kerry"
"One observer, Father W"
"Ferris, described two main forms of caid during this period: the ""field game"" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic ""cross-country game"" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary"
"""Wrestling"", ""holding"" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.
By the 1870s, rugby and association football had started to become popular in Ireland"
Trinity College Dublin was an early stronghold of rugby (see the Developments in the 1850s section above)
The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely
"Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a ""rough-and-tumble game"" which allowed tripping.
There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884"
"The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject imported games like rugby and association football"
The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on 7 February 1887
Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football
"The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).


=== Schism in Rugby football ===

The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code"
"Professionalism had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.
In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries"
"This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England"
"In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU)"
The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements
"However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.
The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better ""spectator"" sport"
"Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the line-out"
"This was followed by the replacement of the ruck with the ""play-the-ball ruck"", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled"
"Mauls were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck"
"The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the first time the name rugby league was used officially in England.
Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as rugby union.


=== Globalisation of association football ===

The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures"
"The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress"
"It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association"
The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904
Its first president was Robert Guérin
"The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.


=== Further divergence of the two rugby codes ===
Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players"
"In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional rugby leagues were launched in Australia the following year"
"However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match"
"This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in Bordeaux.
During the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further"
"In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of downs: a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately)"
" The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the six tackle rule.
With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10 metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.
The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league"
"In particular, goals from marks were abolished, kicks directly into touch from outside the 22 metre line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ruck or maul, and the lifting of players in line-outs was legalised.
In 1995, rugby union became an ""open"" game, that is one which allowed professional players"
"Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared – and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification – the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.


== Use of the word ""football"" ==

The word football, when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above"
"Because of this, much controversy has occurred over the term football, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world"
"Most often, the word ""football"" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region (which is association football in most countries)"
"So, effectively, what the word ""football"" means usually depends on where one says it.

In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as ""football"", while the others generally require a qualifier"
"In New Zealand, ""football"" historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football"
"The sport meant by the word ""football"" in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line)"
"In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football américain and association football is known as le soccer.Of the 45 national FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently use Football in their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates in Canada and the United States use Soccer in their names"
"A few FIFA affiliates have recently ""normalised"" to using ""Football"", including:

Australia's association football governing body changed its name in 2005 from using ""soccer"" to ""football""
New Zealand's governing body renamed itself in 2007, saying ""the international game is called football.""
Samoa changed from ""Samoa Football (Soccer) Federation"" to ""Football Federation Samoa"" in 2009.


== Popularity ==
Several of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world"
"Globally, association football is played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations, and has the highest television audience in sport, making it the most popular in the world"
"American football, with 1.1 million high school football players and nearly 70,000 college football players, is the most popular sport in the United States, with the annual Super Bowl game accounting for nine of the top ten of the most watched broadcasts in U.S"
television history
"The NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world and has the highest revenue out of any single professional sports league"
"Thus, the best association football and American football players are among the highest paid athletes in the world.Australian rules football has the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia"
"Similarly, Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance, and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event of that nation's sporting year.Rugby union is the most popular sport in New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji"
"It is also the fastest growing sport in the U.S., with college rugby being the fastest growing college sport in that country.

"Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop"
"A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three"
"After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws"
"The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill"
"On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard"
"It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.
The five players on each side fall into five playing positions"
"The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning)"
"Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.

== History ==


=== Creation ===

In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical education and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day"
He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters
"After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall"
Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track
"Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each ""basket"" or point scored"
"This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket.

Basketball was originally played with a soccer ball"
"These round balls from ""association football"" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in"
These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable
"Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith (whereas in American football, the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day)"
"The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use"
"Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the ""bounce pass"" to teammates"
Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement
Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls
"Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble by 1898.The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards"
"A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through"
"Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point"
Whichever team got the most points won the game
"The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots"
The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots
"Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called duck on a rock, as many had failed before it.Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game"
Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started
"Mahan suggested that it be called ""Naismith ball"", at which he laughed, saying that a name like that would kill any game"
"Mahan then said, ""Why not call it basketball?"" Naismith replied, ""We have a basket and a ball, and it seems to me that would be a good name for it."" The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players"
"The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court.
At the time, soccer was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11)"
"When winter weather got too icy to play soccer, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side"
"By 1897–1898 teams of five became standard.


=== College basketball ===

Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through the United States and Canada"
"By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools"
"While YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from YMCA's primary mission"
"However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void"
"In the years before World War I, the Amateur Athletic Union and the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (forerunner of the NCAA) vied for control over the rules for the game"
"The first pro league, the National Basketball League, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game"
"This league only lasted five years.
James Naismith was instrumental in establishing college basketball"
His colleague C
O
Beamis fielded the first college basketball team just a year after the Springfield YMCA game at the suburban Pittsburgh Geneva College
"Naismith himself later coached at the University of Kansas for six years, before handing the reins to renowned coach Forrest ""Phog"" Allen"
"Naismith's disciple Amos Alonzo Stagg brought basketball to the University of Chicago, while Adolph Rupp, a student of Naismith's at Kansas, enjoyed great success as coach at the University of Kentucky"
"On February 9, 1895, the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at Hamline University between Hamline and the School of Agriculture, which was affiliated with the University of Minnesota"
"The School of Agriculture won in a 9–3 game.
In 1901, colleges, including the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, the University of Minnesota, the U.S"
"Naval Academy, the University of Colorado and Yale University began sponsoring men's games"
"In 1905, frequent injuries on the football field prompted President Theodore Roosevelt to suggest that colleges form a governing body, resulting in the creation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS)"
"In 1910, that body changed its name to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)"
"The first Canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at YMCA in Kingston, Ontario on February 6, 1904, when McGill University – Naismith's alma mater – visited Queen's University"
"McGill won 9–7 in overtime; the score was 7–7 at the end of regulation play, and a ten-minute overtime period settled the outcome"
"A good turnout of spectators watched the game.The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) tournament, was organized in 1937"
"The first national championship for NCAA teams, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national tournament began one year later"
"College basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in match fixing and point shaving"
"Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the NCAA tournament.


=== High school basketball ===

Before widespread school district consolidation, most American high schools were far smaller than their present-day counterparts"
"During the first decades of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements"
"In the days before widespread television coverage of professional and college sports, the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of America"
"Perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was Indiana's Franklin Wonder Five, which took the nation by storm during the 1920s, dominating Indiana basketball and earning national recognition.
Today virtually every high school in the United States fields a basketball team in varsity competition"
"Basketball's popularity remains high, both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire community, as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after graduation"
"In the 2016–17 season, 980,673 boys and girls represented their schools in interscholastic basketball competition, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations"
"The states of Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky are particularly well known for their residents' devotion to high school basketball, commonly called Hoosier Hysteria in Indiana; the critically acclaimed film Hoosiers shows high school basketball's depth of meaning to these communities.

⁣There is currently no tournament to determine a national high school champion"
The most serious effort was the National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament at the University of Chicago from 1917 to 1930
The event was organized by Amos Alonzo Stagg and sent invitations to state champion teams
The tournament started out as a mostly Midwest affair but grew
In 1929 it had 29 state champions
Faced with opposition from the National Federation of State High School Associations and North Central Association of Colleges and Schools that bore a threat of the schools losing their accreditation the last tournament was in 1930
The organizations said they were concerned that the tournament was being used to recruit professional players from the prep ranks
"The tournament did not invite minority schools or private/parochial schools.
The National Catholic Interscholastic Basketball Tournament ran from 1924 to 1941 at Loyola University"
"The National Catholic Invitational Basketball Tournament from 1954 to 1978 played at a series of venues, including Catholic University, Georgetown and George Mason"
The National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament for Black High Schools was held from 1929 to 1942 at Hampton Institute
The National Invitational Interscholastic Basketball Tournament was held from 1941 to 1967 starting out at Tuskegee Institute
Following a pause during World War II it resumed at Tennessee State College in Nashville
The basis for the champion dwindled after 1954 when Brown v
Board of Education began an integration of schools
"The last tournaments were held at Alabama State College from 1964 to 1967.


=== Professional basketball ===

Teams abounded throughout the 1920s"
"There were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game"
Players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls
Leagues came and went
"Barnstorming squads such as the Original Celtics and two all-African American teams, the New York Renaissance Five (""Rens"") and the (still existing) Harlem Globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours.
In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed"
"The first game was played in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November 1, 1946"
"Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA)"
"By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball"
"In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site of the first game"
"Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of the game"
The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball
"An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976"
"Today the NBA is the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.
The NBA has featured many famous players, including George Mikan, the first dominating ""big man""; ball-handling wizard Bob Cousy and defensive genius Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics; charismatic center Wilt Chamberlain, who originally played for the barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters; all-around stars Oscar Robertson and Jerry West; more recent big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone; playmakers John Stockton, Isiah Thomas and Steve Nash; crowd-pleasing forwards Julius Erving and Charles Barkley; European stars Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol and Tony Parker; Latin American stars Manu Ginobili, more recent superstars, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Giannis Antetokounmpo, etc; and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of popularity during the 1980s and 1990s: Larry Bird, Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson, and Michael Jordan.
In 2001, the NBA formed a developmental league, the National Basketball Development League (later known as the NBA D-League and then the NBA G League after a branding deal with Gatorade)"
"As of the 2021–22 season, the G League has 30 teams.


=== International basketball ===

FIBA (International Basketball Federation) was formed in 1932 by eight founding nations: Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland"
"At this time, the organization only oversaw amateur players"
"Its acronym, derived from the French Fédération Internationale de Basket-ball Amateur, was thus ""FIBA"""
"Men's basketball was first included at the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics, although a demonstration tournament was held in 1904"
"The United States defeated Canada in the first final, played outdoors"
"This competition has usually been dominated by the United States, whose team has won all but three titles"
"The first of these came in a controversial final game in Munich in 1972 against the Soviet Union, in which the ending of the game was replayed three times until the Soviet Union finally came out on top"
"In 1950 the first FIBA World Championship for men, now known as the FIBA Basketball World Cup, was held in Argentina"
"Three years later, the first FIBA World Championship for women, now known as the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, was held in Chile"
"Women's basketball was added to the Olympics in 1976, which were held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada with teams such as the Soviet Union, Brazil and Australia rivaling the American squads.
In 1989, FIBA allowed professional NBA players to participate in the Olympics for the first time"
"Prior to the 1992 Summer Olympics, only European and South American teams were allowed to field professionals in the Olympics"
The United States' dominance continued with the introduction of the original Dream Team
"In the 2004 Athens Olympics, the United States suffered its first Olympic loss while using professional players, falling to Puerto Rico (in a 19-point loss) and Lithuania in group games, and being eliminated in the semifinals by Argentina"
"It eventually won the bronze medal defeating Lithuania, finishing behind Argentina and Italy"
"The Redeem Team, won gold at the 2008 Olympics, and the B-Team, won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey despite featuring no players from the 2008 squad"
"The United States continued its dominance as they won gold at the 2012 Olympics, 2014 FIBA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.

Worldwide, basketball tournaments are held for boys and girls of all age levels"
The global popularity of the sport is reflected in the nationalities represented in the NBA
Players from all six inhabited continents currently play in the NBA
"Top international players began coming into the NBA in the mid-1990s, including Croatians Dražen Petrović and Toni Kukoč, Serbian Vlade Divac, Lithuanians Arvydas Sabonis and Šarūnas Marčiulionis, Dutchman Rik Smits and German Detlef Schrempf.
In the Philippines, the Philippine Basketball Association's first game was played on April 9, 1975, at the Araneta Coliseum in Cubao, Quezon City, Philippines"
"It was founded as a ""rebellion"" of several teams from the now-defunct Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association, which was tightly controlled by the Basketball Association of the Philippines (now defunct), the then-FIBA recognized national association"
"Nine teams from the MICAA participated in the league's first season that opened on April 9, 1975"
The NBL is Australia's pre-eminent men's professional basketball league
"The league commenced in 1979, playing a winter season (April–September) and did so until the completion of the 20th season in 1998"
"The 1998–99 season, which commenced only months later, was the first season after the shift to the current summer season format (October–April)"
This shift was an attempt to avoid competing directly against Australia's various football codes
It features 8 teams from around Australia and one in New Zealand
"A few players including Luc Longley, Andrew Gaze, Shane Heal, Chris Anstey and Andrew Bogut made it big internationally, becoming poster figures for the sport in Australia"
"The Women's National Basketball League began in 1981.


=== Women's basketball ===

Women's basketball began in 1892 at Smith College when Senda Berenson, a physical education teacher, modified Naismith's rules for women"
"Shortly after she was hired at Smith, she went to Naismith to learn more about the game"
"Fascinated by the new sport and the values it could teach, she organized the first women's collegiate basketball game on March 21, 1893, when her Smith freshmen and sophomores played against one another"
"However, the first women's interinstitutional game was played in 1892 between the University of California and Miss Head's School"
"Berenson's rules were first published in 1899, and two years later she became the editor of A"
G
Spalding's first Women's Basketball Guide
"Berenson's freshmen played the sophomore class in the first women's intercollegiate basketball game at Smith College, March 21, 1893"
"The same year, Mount Holyoke and Sophie Newcomb College (coached by Clara Gregory Baer) women began playing basketball"
"By 1895, the game had spread to colleges across the country, including Wellesley, Vassar, and Bryn Mawr"
"The first intercollegiate women's game was on April 4, 1896"
"Stanford women played Berkeley, 9-on-9, ending in a 2–1 Stanford victory.
Women's basketball development was more structured than that for men in the early years"
"In 1905, the executive committee on Basket Ball Rules (National Women's Basketball Committee) was created by the American Physical Education Association"
These rules called for six to nine players per team and 11 officials
The International Women's Sports Federation (1924) included a women's basketball competition
37 women's high school varsity basketball or state tournaments were held by 1925
"And in 1926, the Amateur Athletic Union backed the first national women's basketball championship, complete with men's rules"
"The Edmonton Grads, a touring Canadian women's team based in Edmonton, Alberta, operated between 1915 and 1940"
"The Grads toured all over North America, and were exceptionally successful"
"They posted a record of 522 wins and only 20 losses over that span, as they met any team that wanted to challenge them, funding their tours from gate receipts"
"The Grads also shone on several exhibition trips to Europe, and won four consecutive exhibition Olympics tournaments, in 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936; however, women's basketball was not an official Olympic sport until 1976"
"The Grads' players were unpaid, and had to remain single"
"The Grads' style focused on team play, without overly emphasizing skills of individual players"
The first women's AAU All-America team was chosen in 1929
"Women's industrial leagues sprang up throughout the United States, producing famous athletes, including Babe Didrikson of the Golden Cyclones, and the All American Red Heads Team, which competed against men's teams, using men's rules"
"By 1938, the women's national championship changed from a three-court game to two-court game with six players per team.

The NBA-backed Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) began in 1997"
"Though it had shaky attendance figures, several marquee players (Lisa Leslie, Diana Taurasi, and Candace Parker among others) have helped the league's popularity and level of competition"
"Other professional women's basketball leagues in the United States, such as the American Basketball League (1996–98), have folded in part because of the popularity of the WNBA"
The WNBA has been looked at by many as a niche league
"However, the league has recently taken steps forward"
"In June 2007, the WNBA signed a contract extension with ESPN"
The new television deal ran from 2009 to 2016
"Along with this deal, came the first-ever rights fees to be paid to a women's professional sports league"
"Over the eight years of the contract, ""millions and millions of dollars"" were ""dispersed to the league's teams."" In a March 12, 2009, article, NBA commissioner David Stern said that in the bad economy, ""the NBA is far less profitable than the WNBA"
We're losing a lot of money among a large number of teams
"We're budgeting the WNBA to break even this year.""


== Rules and regulations ==

Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations; international and NBA rules are used in this section.
The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own"
An attempt to score in this way is called a shot
"A successful shot is worth two points, or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6.75 metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games and 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) in NBA games"
A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made
"After a team has scored from a field goal or free throw, play is resumed with a throw-in awarded to the non-scoring team taken from a point beyond the endline of the court where the points were scored.


=== Playing regulations ===
Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA) or 12 minutes (NBA)"
"College men's games use two 20-minute halves, college women's games use 10-minute quarters, and most United States high school varsity games use 8-minute quarters; however, this varies from state to state"
"15 minutes are allowed for a half-time break under FIBA, NBA, and NCAA rules and 10 minutes in United States high schools"
"Overtime periods are five minutes in length except for high school, which is four minutes in length"
Teams exchange baskets for the second half
The time allowed is actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active
"Therefore, games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time, typically about two hours.
Five players from each team may be on the court at one time"
Substitutions are unlimited but can only be done when play is stopped
"Teams also have a coach, who oversees the development and strategies of the team, and other team personnel such as assistant coaches, managers, statisticians, doctors and trainers.
For both men's and women's teams, a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey with a clearly visible number, unique within the team, printed on both the front and back"
Players wear high-top sneakers that provide extra ankle support
"Typically, team names, players' names and, outside of North America, sponsors are printed on the uniforms.
A limited number of time-outs, clock stoppages requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated in the NBA) for a short meeting with the players, are allowed"
"They generally last no longer than one minute (100 seconds in the NBA) unless, for televised games, a commercial break is needed.
The game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee (referred to as crew chief in the NBA), one or two umpires (referred to as referees in the NBA) and the table officials"
"For college, the NBA, and many high schools, there are a total of three referees on the court"
"The table officials are responsible for keeping track of each team's scoring, timekeeping, individual and team fouls, player substitutions, team possession arrow, and the shot clock.


=== Equipment ===

The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends"
"Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets, scoreboards, alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems.

A regulation basketball court in international games is 28 meters (92 feet) long and 15 meters (49 feet) wide"
In the NBA and NCAA the court is 94 by 50 feet (29 by 15 meters)
"Most courts have wood flooring, usually constructed from maple planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension"
"The name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle.
The basket is a steel rim 18 inches (46 cm) diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures 6 by 3.5 feet (1.8 by 1.1 meters) and one basket is at each end of the court"
The white outlined box on the backboard is 18 inches (46 cm) high and 2 feet (61 cm) wide
"At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is exactly 10 feet (3.05 meters) above the court and 4 feet (1.22 meters) inside the baseline"
"While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height – a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting"
"The net must ""check the ball momentarily as it passes through the basket"" to aid the visual confirmation that the ball went through"
 The act of checking the ball has the further advantage of slowing down the ball so the rebound doesn't go as far.The size of the basketball is also regulated
"For men, the official ball is 29.5 inches (75 cm) in circumference (size 7, or a ""295 ball"") and weighs 22 oz (620 g)"
"If women are playing, the official basketball size is 28.5 inches (72 cm) in circumference (size 6, or a ""285 ball"") with a weight of 20 oz (570 g)"
"In 3x3, a formalized version of the halfcourt 3-on-3 game, a dedicated ball with the circumference of a size 6 ball but the weight of a size 7 ball is used in all competitions (men's, women's, and mixed teams).


=== Violations ===

The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running).
The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession"
"The ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line, or touches any player or object that is out of bounds.
There are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling, which commonly results in an infraction known as traveling"
Nor may a player stop their dribble and then resume dribbling
"A dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name double dribble"
"Within a dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing their hand on the bottom of the ball; doing so is known as carrying the ball"
"A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it"
"A violation of these rules results in loss of possession.
The ball may not be kicked, nor be struck with the fist"
"For the offense, a violation of these rules results in loss of possession; for the defense, most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds.
There are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in FIBA and the NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA and high school for both sexes), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in FIBA, the NBA, and U Sports (Canadian universities) play for both sexes, and 30 seconds in NCAA play for both sexes), holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane, (or the ""key"") (3 seconds)"
"These rules are designed to promote more offense.
There are also limits on how players may block an opponent's field goal attempt or help a teammate's field goal attempt"
"Goaltending is a defender's touching of a ball that is on a downward flight toward the basket, while the related violation of basket interference is the touching of a ball that is on the rim or above the basket, or by a player reaching through the basket from below"
"Goaltending and basket interference committed by a defender result in awarding the basket to the offense, while basket interference committed by an offensive player results in cancelling the basket if one is scored"
"The defense gains possession in all cases of goaltending or basket interference.


=== Fouls ===

An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types of physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul"
"These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well"
"Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful"
"One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.6 m) from the basket.
The referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal, sometimes resulting in controversy"
"The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and referees.
There is a second category of fouls called technical fouls, which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike conduct"
"These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time"
Repeated incidents can result in disqualification
A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA)
"In FIBA and NCAA women's basketball, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.
If a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) – four for NBA, NCAA women's, and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league"
"In the US college men's game and high school games for both sexes, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made"
"This is called shooting ""one-and-one"""
"If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half.
When a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air.
After a team has committed a specified number of fouls, the other team is said to be ""in the bonus"""
"On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading ""Bonus"" or ""Penalty"" with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team"
"(Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.)
If a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play.
If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot"
"A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot thus receives two shots, and a player fouled while attempting a three-point shot receives three shots.
If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point"
"In combination with a regular shot, this is called a ""three-point play"" or ""four-point play"" (or more colloquially, an ""and one"") because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point).


== Common techniques and practices ==


=== Positions ===

Although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball"
"During the early years of basketball's evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used"
"In more recent times specific positions evolved, but the current trend, advocated by many top coaches including Mike Krzyzewski, is towards positionless basketball, where big players are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it"
"Popular descriptions of positions include:
Point guard (often called the ""1"") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.
Shooting guard (the ""2"") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense.
Small forward (the ""3"") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.
Power forward (the ""4""): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense).
Center (the ""5""): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.
The above descriptions are flexible"
"For most teams today, the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called the wings, as do the power forward and center, who are often called post players"
"While most teams describe two players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a center, on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations.


=== Strategy ===

There are two main defensive strategies: zone defense and man-to-man defense"
"In a zone defense, each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court"
"Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball, a manoeuver known as a trap"
"In a man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards a specific opponent.
Offensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball"
A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a cut
"A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a screen or pick"
"The two plays are combined in the pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then ""rolls"" away from the pick towards the basket"
"Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork, which can lead to a successful basket"
Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable
"On court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur.


=== Shooting ===

Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.
Typically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket"
"A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball"
The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm
"The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through"
Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim
"The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended"
"Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.

The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot"
Both are preceded by a crouching action which preloads the muscles and increases the power of the shot
"In a set shot, the shooter straightens up and throws from a standing position with neither foot leaving the floor; this is typically used for free throws"
"For a jump shot, the throw is taken in mid-air with the ball being released near the top of the jump"
"This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender"
"Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.
Another common shot is called the layup"
"This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to ""lay"" the ball ""up"" and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a finger roll)"
"The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk, in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, through the basket while touching it.

Another shot that is less common than the layup, is the ""circus shot"""
"The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down or facing away from the basket"
"A back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket, and may be shot with the dominant hand, or both; but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful.A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an air ball"
"A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a brick"
"The hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, layup or jump shot.


=== Rebounding ===

The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard"
"This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot"
"There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball"
"The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.


=== Passing ===

A pass is a method of moving the ball between players"
"Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.
A staple pass is the chest pass"
The ball is passed directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest
"A proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react.
Another type of pass is the bounce pass"
"Here, the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver"
The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver
"The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation)"
"Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.
The overhead pass is used to pass the ball over a defender"
"The ball is released while over the passer's head.
The outlet pass occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound"
"The next pass after the rebound is the outlet pass.
The crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept"
Good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball
A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate
"This is called a no-look pass.
Another advanced style of passing is the behind-the-back pass, which, as the description implies, involves throwing the ball behind the passer's back to a teammate"
"Although some players can perform such a pass effectively, many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations.


=== Dribbling ===

Dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball"
"To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater control.
When dribbling past an opponent, the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent, making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball"
"It is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.
Good dribblers (or ""ball handlers"") tend to keep their dribbling hand low to the ground, reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand, making it more difficult for the defender to ""steal"" the ball"
"Good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs, between their legs, and switch directions suddenly, making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against"
"This is called a crossover, which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling.
A skilled player can dribble without watching the ball, using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision to keep track of the ball's location"
"By not having to focus on the ball, a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him/her.


=== Blocking ===

A block is performed when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball"
"In almost all variants of play, it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as goaltending"
"It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim"
Under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim
"After the ball hits the rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.
To block a shot, a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released"
"Thus, height can be an advantage in blocking"
Players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions
"However, with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap, even shorter players can be effective shot blockers.


== Height ==

At the professional level, most male players are above 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) and most women above 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m)"
"Guards, for whom physical coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial, tend to be the smallest players"
Almost all forwards in the top men's pro leagues are 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) or taller
Most centers are over 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m) tall
"According to a survey given to all NBA teams, the average height of all NBA players is just under 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), with the average weight being close to 222 pounds (101 kg)"
"The tallest players ever in the NBA were Manute Bol and Gheorghe Mureșan, who were both 7 feet 7 inches (2.31 m) tall"
"At 7 feet 2 inches (2.18 m), Margo Dydek was the tallest player in the history of the WNBA.
The shortest player ever to play in the NBA is Muggsy Bogues at 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m)"
"Other average-height or relatively short players have thrived at the pro level, including Anthony ""Spud"" Webb, who was 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) tall, but had a 42-inch (1.1 m) vertical leap, giving him significant height when jumping, and Temeka Johnson, who won the WNBA Rookie of the Year Award and a championship with the Phoenix Mercury while standing only 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m)"
"While shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game, their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths.
Players regularly inflate their height in high school or college"
"Many prospects exaggerate their height while in high school or college to make themselves more appealing to coaches and scouts, who prefer taller players"
"Charles Barkley stated; ""I've been measured at 6-5, 6-4+3⁄4"
"But I started in college at 6-6."" Sam Smith, a former writer from the Chicago Tribune, said: ""We sort of know the heights, because after camp, the sheet comes out"
"But you use that height, and the player gets mad"
And then you hear from his agent
"Or you file your story with the right height, and the copy desk changes it because they have the 'official' N.B.A"
"media guide, which is wrong"
"So you sort of go along with the joke.""Since the 2019-20 NBA season heights of NBA players are recorded definitively by measuring players with their shoes off.


== Variations and similar games ==

Variations of basketball are activities based on the game of basketball, using common basketball skills and equipment (primarily the ball and basket)"
"Some variations only have superficial rule changes, while others are distinct games with varying degrees of influence from basketball"
"Other variations include children's games, contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.
An earlier version of basketball, played primarily by women and girls, was six-on-six basketball"
Horseball is a game played on horseback where a ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net (approximately 1.5m×1.5m)
"The sport is like a combination of polo, rugby, and basketball"
"There is even a form played on donkeys known as Donkey basketball, which has attracted criticism from animal rights groups.


=== Half-court ===
Perhaps the single most common variation of basketball is the half-court game, played in informal settings without referees or strict rules"
"Only one basket is used, and the ball must be ""taken back"" or ""cleared"" – passed or dribbled outside the three-point line each time possession of the ball changes from one team to the other"
"Half-court games require less cardiovascular stamina, since players need not run back and forth a full court"
"Half-court raises the number of players that can use a court or, conversely, can be played if there is an insufficient number to form full 5-on-5 teams.
Half-court basketball is usually played 1-on-1, 2-on-2 or 3-on-3"
"The latter variation is gradually gaining official recognition as 3x3, originally known as FIBA 33"
"It was first tested at the 2007 Asian Indoor Games in Macau and the first official tournaments were held at the 2009 Asian Youth Games and the 2010 Youth Olympics, both in Singapore"
"The first FIBA 3x3 Youth World Championships were held in Rimini, Italy in 2011, with the first FIBA 3x3 World Championships for senior teams following a year later in Athens"
The sport is highly tipped to become an Olympic sport as early as 2016
"In the summer of 2017, the BIG3 basketball league, a professional 3x3 half court basketball league that features former NBA players, began"
"The BIG3 features several rule variants including a four-point field goal.


=== Other variations ===
Variations of basketball with their own page or subsection include:

One-on-one is a variation in which two players will use only a small section of the court (often no more than a half of a court) and compete to play the ball into a single hoop"
"Such games tend to emphasize individual dribbling and ball stealing skills over shooting and team play.
Dunk Hoops is a variation played on basketball hoops with lowered (under basketball regulation 10 feet) rims"
"It originated when the popularity of the slam dunk grew and was developed to create better chances for dunks with lowered rims and using altered goaltending rules.
Unicycle basketball is played using a regulation basketball on a regular basketball court with the same rules, for example, one must dribble the ball while riding"
"There are a number of rules that are particular to unicycle basketball as well, for example, a player must have at least one foot on a pedal when in-bounding the ball"
"Unicycle basketball is usually played using 24"" or smaller unicycles, and using plastic pedals, both to preserve the court and the players' shins"
"Popular unicycle basketball games are organized in North America.Spin-offs from basketball that are now separate sports include:

Ringball, a traditional South African sport that stems from basketball, has been played since 1907"
"The sport is now promoted in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, India, and Mauritius to establish Ringball as an international sport.
Korfball (Dutch: Korfbal, korf meaning 'basket') started in the Netherlands and is now played worldwide as a mixed-gender team ball game, similar to mixed netball and basketball.
Netball is a limited-contact team sport in which two teams of seven try to score points against one another by placing a ball through a high hoop"
Australia New Zealand champions (so called ANZ Championship) is very famous in Australia and New Zealand as the premier netball league
"Formerly played exclusively by women, netball today features mixed-gender competitions.
Slamball, invented by television writer Mason Gordon, is a full-contact sport featuring trampolines"
"The main difference from basketball is the court; below the padded rim and backboard are four trampolines set into the floor, which serve to propel players to great heights for slam dunks"
The rules also permit some physical contact between the members of the four-player teams
"Professional games of Slamball aired on Spike TV in 2002, and the sport has since expanded to China and other countries.
		
		
		


== Social forms of basketball ==

Basketball as a social and communal sport features environments, rules and demographics different from those seen in professional and televised basketball.


=== Recreational basketball ===
Basketball is played widely as an extracurricular, intramural or amateur sport in schools and colleges"
"Notable institutions of recreational basketball include:

Basketball schools and academies, where students are trained in developing basketball fundamentals, undergo fitness and endurance exercises and learn various basketball skills"
"Basketball students learn proper ways of passing, ball handling, dribbling, shooting from various distances, rebounding, offensive moves, defense, layups, screens, basketball rules and basketball ethics"
"Also popular are the basketball camps organized for various occasions, often to get prepared for basketball events, and basketball clinics for improving skills.
College and university basketball played in educational institutions of higher learning"
"This includes National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) intercollegiate basketball.


=== Disabled basketball ===
Deaf basketball: One of several deaf sports, deaf basketball relies on signing for communication"
"Any deaf sporting event that happens, its purpose is to serve as a catalyst for the socialization of a low-incidence and geographically dispersed population.
Wheelchair basketball: A sport based on basketball but designed for disabled people in wheelchairs and considered one of the major disabled sports practiced"
There is a functional classification system that is used to help determine if the wheelchair basketball player classification system reflects the existing differences in the performance of elite female players
This system gives an analysis of the players' functional resources through field-testing and game observation
"During this system's process, players are assigned a score of 1 to 4.5.


=== Other forms ===
Biddy basketball played by minors, sometimes in formal tournaments, around the globe.
Gay basketball played in LGBTQIA+ communities"
"The sport is a major event during the Gay Games, World Outgames and EuroGames.

Rezball, short for reservation ball, is the avid Native American following of basketball, particularly a style of play particular to Native American teams of some areas.


== Fantasy basketball ==

Fantasy basketball was popularized during the 1990s by ESPN Fantasy Sports, NBA.com, and Yahoo! Fantasy Sports"
"On the model of fantasy baseball and football, players create fictional teams, select professional basketball players to ""play"" on these teams through a mock draft or trades, then calculate points based on the players' real-world performance.

James Naismith (1861–1939)
"Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch"
The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposite team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing side
"Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes"
"With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is considered the world's most popular sport.
The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886"
The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference
"The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal"
"When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball"
"Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area"
The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner
"Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout.Internationally, association football is governed by FIFA"
"Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA"
National associations (e.g
"The FA or JFA) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game"
The most senior and prestigious international competitions are the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup
"The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic Games"
"The two most prestigious competitions in European club football are the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League, which attract an extensive television audience throughout the world"
"The final of the men's tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.Women's association football has historically seen opposition, with national associations severely curbing its development and several outlawing it completely"
Restrictions started to be reduced in the 1970s and the first official women's World Cup was the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup in China with only 12 teams from the respective six confederations
"By the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France, this had increased to 24 national teams, and a record-breaking 1.12 billion viewers watched the competition.


== Name ==

Association football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity"
"Within the English-speaking world, the sport is now usually called ""football"" in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually call it ""soccer"" in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent, such as Australia, Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster), and the United States; in Japan, the game is also primarily called sakkācode: jpn promoted to code: ja  (サッカーcode: jpn promoted to code: ja ), derived from ""soccer"""
"A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, ""football"" has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and rugby league.The term soccer comes from Oxford ""-er"" slang, which was prevalent at the University of Oxford in England from about 1875, and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of Rugby School"
"Initially spelled assoccer, it was later reduced to the modern spelling"
"This form of slang also gave rise to rugger for rugby football, fiver and tenner for five pound and ten pound notes, and the now-archaic footer that was also a name for association football"
"The word soccer arrived at its final form in 1895 and was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of socca.


== History ==

Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures"
Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games
An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a stele of c. 375–400 BCE in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy
"Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE, mentions the Roman ball game harpastumcode: lat promoted to code: la "
"Phaininda, episkyros and harpastumcode: lat promoted to code: la  were played involving hands and violence"
"They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling and volleyball more than what is recognizable as modern football"
"As with pre-codified mob football, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking it.The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally ""kick ball""; also known as tsu chu) resembles modern association football"
Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was to kick a ball through an opening into a net
"During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were established"
Other East Asian games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea
"The Japanese kemari, influenced by cuju, originated around the year 600 during the Asuka period"
"It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a mari, a ball made of animal skin"
"In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was described as ""almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals"".Association football in itself does not have a classical history"
"Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world, FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe"
The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England
"The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century.

The Cambridge rules, first drawn up at the University of Cambridge in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football"
"The Cambridge rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools"
They were not universally adopted
"During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football"
"Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to the formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867"
"In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London"
The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse
"The Freemasons' Tavern was the setting for five more meetings of The FA between October and December 1863; the English FA eventually issued the first comprehensive set of rules named Laws of the Game, forming modern football"
"At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath F.C., withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding"
"Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA, and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union"
"The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game"
"These rules included handling of the ball by ""marks"" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia"
"The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s, with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.
The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by the footballer and cricketer Charles W"
"Alcock, and has been contested by English teams since 1872"
"The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of Alcock"
"England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor"
The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.Laws of the Game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB)
"The board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of the Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association"
"FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to the Laws of the Game of the Football Association"
The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913
"The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.For most of the 20th century, Europe and South America were the dominant regions in association football"
"The FIFA World Cup, inaugurated in 1930, became the main stage for players of both continents to show their worth and the strength of their national teams"
"In the second half of the century, the European Cup and the Copa Libertadores were created, and the champions of these two club competitions would contest the Intercontinental Cup to prove which team was the best in the world.In the 21st century, South America has continued to produce some of the best footballers in the world, but its clubs have fallen behind the still dominant European clubs, which often sign the best players from Latin America and elsewhere"
"Meanwhile, football has improved in Africa, Asia and North America, and nowadays, these regions are at least on equal grounds with South America in club football, although countries in the Caribbean and Oceania regions (except Australia) have yet to make a mark in international football"
"When it comes to national teams, however, Europeans and South Americans continue to dominate the FIFA World Cup, as no team from any other region has managed to even reach the final.Football is played at a professional level all over the world"
"Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet"
A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level
"According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football"
"Football has the highest global television audience in sport.In many parts of the world, football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations"
"Ryszard Kapuściński says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games"
"The Ivory Coast national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouaké, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time"
"By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras"
"The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.


=== Women's association football ===

Women may have been playing football for as long as the game has existed"
"Evidence shows that a similar ancient game (cuju, or tsu chu) was played by women during the Han dynasty (25–220 CE), as female figures are depicted in frescoes of the period playing tsu chu"
"There are also reports of annual football matches played by women in Midlothian, Scotland, during the 1790s.

Association football, the modern game, has documented early involvement of women"
"In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play"
The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow
"In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895"
"Women's football has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.The best-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894"
It was named the British Ladies' Football Club
"Honeyball is quoted as, ""I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured"
"I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most."" Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football"
"However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations and continued without their support"
"It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the ""masculinity"" of the game.Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when female employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men 50 years earlier"
"The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr Ladies F.C"
"of Preston, England"
"The team played in one of the first women's international matches against a French XI team in 1920, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in the same year, winning 22–0.Despite being more popular than some men's football events, with one match seeing a 53,000 strong crowd in 1920, women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on association members' pitches, stating that ""the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged"""
"Players and football writers have argued that this ban was, in fact, due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted, and because the FA had no control over the money made from the women's game"
"The FA ban led to the formation of the short-lived English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.

Association football continued to be played by women since the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century"
"In December 1969, the Women's Football Association was formed in England, and in 1971, Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) members voted to officially recognise women's football"
"Also in 1971, The Football Association rescinded the ban that prohibited women from playing on association members' pitches"
"In the late 1960s and early 1970s, women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for British women"
"Women's football also faced bans in several other countries, notably in Brazil from 1941 to 1979, in France from 1941 to 1970, and in Germany from 1955 to 1970.Women's football still faces many struggles, but its worldwide growth has seen major competitions being launched at both the national and international levels, mirroring the men's competitions"
"The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since, while women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996"
"North America is the dominant region in women's football, with the United States winning most FIFA Women's World Cups and Olympic tournaments"
"Europe and Asia come second and third in terms of international success, and the women's game has been improving in South America.


== Gameplay ==

Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game"
"The game is played using a spherical ball of 68–70 cm (27–28 in) circumference, known as the football (or soccer ball)"
"Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal"
The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw
"Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or penalty kicks.The primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart"
"Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, ""heading"" with the forehead) other than their hands or arms"
"Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper"
"Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted"
"Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules"
"After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.

At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals"
"For example, the 2005–06 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.48 goals per match"
"The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles have evolved"
"Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team"
"Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper.
These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends the most time"
"For example, there are central defenders and left and right midfielders"
The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination
"The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play"
"While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time"
The layout of a team's players is known as a formation
"Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.


== Laws ==

There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulations and guidelines"
"The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football for both sexes, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors and people with physical disabilities are permitted"
"The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game"
"The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the IFAB"
"In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of association football"
"Within the United States, Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s and the National Federation of State High School Associations and National Collegiate Athletic Association still use rulesets that are comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.


=== Players, equipment, and officials ===

Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper"
"Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven"
"Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal"
"Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.The basic equipment or kit players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards"
An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals
"Headgear is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury"
"Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches"
The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game
"The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is five in 90 minutes, with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time; the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches"
"Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game"
"In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match"
"IFAB recommends ""that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team"""
"Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.
A game is officiated by a referee, who has ""full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed"" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final"
The referee is assisted by two assistant referees
In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.Goal line technology is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining whether a goal has been scored or not; this was brought in to prevent controversy
Video assistant referees (VAR) have also been increasingly introduced in high-level matches to assist officials through video replays to correct clear and obvious mistakes
"There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.


=== Ball ===

The ball is spherical with a circumference of between 68 and 70 cm (27 and 28 in), a weight in the range of 410 to 450 g (14 to 16 oz), and a pressure between 0.6 and 1.1 standard atmospheres (8.5 and 15.6 pounds per square inch) at sea level"
"In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation, but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.


=== Pitch ===

As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units"
"The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110 m (110–120 yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75 m (70–80 yd)"
"Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120 m (100–130 yd) in length and 45–90 m (50–100 yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square"
"In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105 m (115 yd) long and 68 m (74 yd) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.The longer boundary lines are touchlines, while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are goal lines"
"A rectangular goal is positioned on each goal line, midway between the two touchlines"
"The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 7.32 m (24 ft) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2.44 m (8 ft) above the ground"
"Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.In front of the goal is the penalty area"
"This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5 m (18 yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5 m (18 yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them"
"This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick"
"Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.


=== Duration and tie-breaking methods ===


==== 90-minute ordinary time ====
A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each"
"Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play"
There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves
The end of the match is known as full-time
"The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages"
"This added time is called ""additional time"" in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as stoppage time or injury time, while lost time can also be used as a synonym"
The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee
"Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play, and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of ""effective playing time"""
The referee alone signals the end of the match
"In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half, the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time they intend to add"
The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number
The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee
Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa
"Trailing 1–0 with two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty kick"
"Villa's goalkeeper deliberately kicked the ball out of play; by the time it was recovered, the clock had run out and the game was over, leaving Stoke unable to attempt the penalty"
"The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed; thus, no game can end with an uncompleted penalty.


==== Tie-breaking ====

In league competitions, games may end in a draw"
"In knockout competitions where a winner is required, various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke replays"
"A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods"
"If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts (known officially in the Laws of the Game as ""kicks from the penalty mark"") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament or be the champion"
"Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament, with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score.In competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses"
"Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home"
"If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.


=== Ball in and out of play ===
Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ball in play and ball out of play"
"From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee"
"When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:
Kick-off: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.
Throw-in: when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.
Goal kick: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team.
Corner kick: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the defending team; awarded to attacking team.
Indirect free kick: awarded to the opposing team following ""non-penal"" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred"
"A goal may not be scored directly (without the ball first touching another player) from an indirect free kick.
Direct free kick: awarded to fouled team following certain listed ""penal"" fouls"
"A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick.
Penalty kick: awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.
Dropped-ball: occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.


=== Misconduct ===


==== On-field ====

A foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play"
The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12
"Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of ""penal fouls"", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred"
Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.The referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card)
"A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal"
"A player given a yellow card is said to have been ""booked"", the referee writing the player's name in their official notebook"
"If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play"
"Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad"
"In particular, the offence of ""unsporting behaviour"" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences"
"A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute, substituted player, and to non-players such as managers and support staff.Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed"
"This is known as ""playing an advantage"""
"The referee may ""call back"" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within ""a few seconds"""
"Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final"
"The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.


==== Off-field ====

Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing"
Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game
"Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card"
Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on clubs as a whole
"Penalties may include fines, point deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions"
"For example, the English Football League deduct 12 points from any team that enters financial administration"
Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture
"Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.


== Governing bodies ==

The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer) is FIFA"
"The FIFA headquarters are located in Zürich, Switzerland"
"Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:
Asia: Asian Football Confederation (AFC)
Africa: Confederation of African Football (CAF)
Europe: Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)
North/Central America & Caribbean: Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF)
Oceania: Oceania Football Confederation (OFC)
South America: Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL)National associations (or national federations) oversee football within individual countries"
"These are generally synonymous with sovereign states (for example, the Cameroonian Football Federation in Cameroon), but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example, the Scottish Football Association in Scotland)"
"211 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the IFAB, where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.


== International competitions ==

International competitions in association football principally consist of two varieties: competitions involving representative national teams or those involving clubs based in multiple nations and national leagues"
"International football, without qualification, most often refers to the former"
"In the case of international club competition, it is the country of origin of the clubs involved, not the nationalities of their players, that renders the competition international in nature.
The major international competition in football is the World Cup, organised by FIFA"
"This competition has taken place every four years since 1930, with the exception of the 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled because of World War II"
Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals
"The finals tournament, held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period"
"The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet"
"The current champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 tournament in Qatar"
The FIFA Women's World Cup has been held every four years since 1991
"Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 31 slots in a three-year qualification phase, with the host nation's team entering automatically as the 32nd slot"
"The current champions are the United States, after winning their fourth title in the 2019 tournament.

There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles"
"Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event"
"Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only"
"As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened"
"The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs"
"Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance"
"For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC decided to admit professional players"
"Since 1992, male competitors must be under 23 years old, although since 1996, three players over the age of 23 have been allowed per squad"
"A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams"
"These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa América (CONMEBOL), the African Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the CONCACAF Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the OFC Nations Cup (OFC)"
"The FIFA Confederations Cup was contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions and the country which was hosting the next World Cup"
This was generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and did not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself
The tournament was discontinued following the 2017 edition
"The UEFA Nations League and the CONCACAF Nations League also exist.
The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example, the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America"
"The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Club World Cup.


== Domestic competitions ==

The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results"
"Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued"
"Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament"
"At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion"
"The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may also be eligible to play in international club competitions in the following season"
"The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for Opening and Closing), awarding a champion for each"
"The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more ""cup"" competitions organised on a knock-out basis.
Some countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries, lower divisions, and most of women's clubs, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs"
"The five top European leagues – Premier League (England), Bundesliga (Germany), La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France) – attract most of the world's best players and, during the 2006-07 season, each of these leagues had a total wage cost in excess of €600 million.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence of humans and other animals"
"Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require ""intelligence"" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect"
"For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an ""AI winter""), followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding"
"AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior"
"In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools"
"The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects"
General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals
"To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics"
"AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence ""can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it"""
"This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity"
Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals
"The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI's true technological capabilities.


== History ==

Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R"
"These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.The study of mechanical or ""formal"" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity"
"The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as ""0"" and ""1"", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction"
This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Church–Turing thesis
"This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain"
"The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete ""artificial neurons"".By the 1950s, two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged"
"One vision, known as Symbolic AI or GOFAI, was to use computers to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that could reason about the world"
"Proponents included Allen Newell, Herbert A"
"Simon, and Marvin Minsky"
"Closely associated with this approach was the ""heuristic search"" approach, which likened intelligence to a problem of exploring a space of possibilities for answers.
The second vision, known as the connectionist approach, sought to achieve intelligence through learning"
"Proponents of this approach, most prominently Frank Rosenblatt, sought to connect Perceptron in ways inspired by connections of neurons"
James Manyika and others have compared the two approaches to the mind (Symbolic AI) and the brain (connectionist)
"Manyika argues that symbolic approaches dominated the push for artificial intelligence in this period, due in part to its connection to intellectual traditions of Descartes, Boole, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and others"
Connectionist approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were pushed to the background but have gained new prominence in recent decades.The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956
The attendees became the founders and leaders of AI research
"They and their students produced programs that the press described as ""astonishing"": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S"
was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world.Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field
"Herbert Simon predicted, ""machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do"""
"Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, ""within a generation .."
"the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved"".They had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks"
"Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S"
and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI
"The next few years would later be called an ""AI winter"", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts"
"By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars"
"At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S"
and British governments to restore funding for academic research
"However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.Many researchers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition"
"A number of researchers began to look into ""sub-symbolic"" approaches to specific AI problems"
"Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move, survive, and learn their environment.Interest in neural networks and ""connectionism"" was revived by Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart and others in the middle of the 1980s"
"Soft computing tools were developed in the 1980s, such as neural networks, fuzzy systems, Grey system theory, evolutionary computation and many tools drawn from statistics or mathematical optimization.
AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by finding specific solutions to specific problems"
"The narrow focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results, exploit more mathematical methods, and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics)"
"By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as ""artificial intelligence"".Faster computers, algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012"
"According to Bloomberg's Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a ""sporadic usage"" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects"
"He attributed this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had ""incorporated AI in some offerings or processes"""
"The amount of research into AI (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.Numerous academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines"
"Much of current research involves statistical AI, which is overwhelmingly used to solve specific problems, even highly successful techniques such as deep learning"
"This concern has led to the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or ""AGI""), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.


== Goals ==
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems"
These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display
"The traits described below have received the most attention.


=== Reasoning, problem-solving ===
Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions"
"By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.Many of these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a ""combinatorial explosion"": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger"
Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model
"They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.


=== Knowledge representation ===

Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts.
A representation of ""what exists"" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them"
"The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern)"
A truly intelligent program would also need access to commonsense knowledge; the set of facts that an average person knows
"The semantics of an ontology is typically represented in description logic, such as the Web Ontology Language.AI research has developed tools to represent specific domains, such as objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);"
default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); as well as other domains
"Among the most difficult problems in AI are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as ""facts"" or ""statements"" that they could express verbally).Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining ""interesting"" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.


=== Learning ===

Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception, is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.Unsupervised learning finds patterns in a stream of input.
Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification and numerical regression"
Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in – the program sees a number of examples of things from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs
Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change
"Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as ""function approximators"" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, ""spam"" or ""not spam"".In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones"
"The agent classifies its responses to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.


=== Natural language processing ===

Natural language processing (NLP)
allows machines to read and understand human language"
"A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts"
"Some straightforward applications of NLP include information retrieval, question answering and machine translation.
Symbolic AI used formal syntax to translate the deep structure of sentences into logic"
"This failed to produce useful applications, due to the intractability of logic and the breadth of commonsense knowledge"
"Modern statistical techniques include co-occurrence frequencies (how often one word appears near another), ""Keyword spotting"" (searching for a particular word to retrieve information), transformer-based deep learning (which finds patterns in text), and others"
"They have achieved acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, and, by 2019, could generate coherent text.


=== Perception ===

Machine perception
is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world"
"Applications include speech recognition,facial recognition, and object recognition.
Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.


=== Social intelligence ===

Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.
For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.
However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are"
"Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.


=== General intelligence ===

A machine with general intelligence can solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence"
There are several competing ideas about how to develop artificial general intelligence
"Hans Moravec and Marvin Minsky argue that work in different individual domains can be incorporated into an advanced multi-agent system or cognitive architecture with general intelligence.Pedro Domingos hopes that there is a conceptually straightforward, but mathematically difficult, ""master algorithm"" that could lead to AGI.
Others believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain
or simulated child development
will someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.


== Tools ==


=== Search and optimization ===

AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions"
Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search
"For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule"
"Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis"
"Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.Simple exhaustive searches
are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers"
The result is a search that is too slow or never completes
"The solution, for many problems, is to use ""heuristics"" or ""rules of thumb"" that prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps"
"In some search methodologies, heuristics can also serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called ""pruning the search tree"")"
"Heuristics supply the program with a ""best guess"" for the path on which the solution lies.
Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.

A very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization"
"For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made"
"These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top"
"Other related optimization algorithms include random optimization, beam search and metaheuristics like simulated annealing"
Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search
"For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses)"
"Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, gene expression programming, and genetic programming"
"Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms"
"Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).


=== Logic ===

Logic
is used for knowledge representation and problem-solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well"
"For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning
and inductive logic programming is a method for learning.Several different forms of logic are used in AI research"
"Propositional logic involves truth functions such as ""or"" and ""not"""
"First-order logic
adds quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other"
"Fuzzy logic assigns a ""degree of truth"" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as ""Alice is old"" (or rich, or tall, or hungry), that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false.Default logics, non-monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem.
Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as description logics;situation calculus, event calculus and fluent calculus (for representing events and time);causal calculus;belief calculus (belief revision); and modal logics.
Logics to model contradictory or inconsistent statements arising in multi-agent systems have also been designed, such as paraconsistent logics.


=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===

Many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information"
"AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.Bayesian networks
are a very general tool that can be used for various problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).
Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).A key concept from the science of economics is ""utility"", a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent"
"Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,
and information value theory"
"These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.


=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===

The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (""if shiny then diamond"") and controllers (""if diamond then pick up"")"
"Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems"
Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match
"They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI"
These examples are known as observations or patterns
"In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class"
A class is a decision that has to be made
All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set
"When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.A classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and machine learning approaches.
The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s.Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.
The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the ""most widely used learner"" at Google, due in part to its scalability.Neural networks are also used for classification.Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, dimensionality, and the level of noise"
Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data
"Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as ""naive Bayes"" on most practical data sets.


=== Artificial neural networks ===

Neural networks
were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain"
"A simple ""neuron"" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or ""fired""), casts a weighted ""vote"" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate"
"Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed ""fire together, wire together"") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another"
"Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes.
Modern neural networks model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data"
They can learn continuous functions and even digital logical operations
Neural networks can be viewed as a type of mathematical optimization – they perform gradient descent on a multi-dimensional topology that was created by training the network
"The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.
Other learning techniques for neural networks are Hebbian learning (""fire together, wire together""), GMDH or competitive learning.The main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and recurrent neural networks (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events)"
"Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks.


==== Deep learning ====

Deep learning
uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs"
The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input
"For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces"
"Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification and others.
Deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks for many or all of its layers"
"In a convolutional layer, each neuron receives input from only a restricted area of the previous layer called the neuron's receptive field"
"This can substantially reduce the number of weighted connections between neurons, and creates a hierarchy similar to the organization of the animal visual cortex.In a recurrent neural network (RNN) the signal will propagate through a layer more than once;
thus, an RNN is an example of deep learning.
RNNs can be trained by gradient descent,
however long-term gradients which are back-propagated can ""vanish"" (that is, they can tend to zero) or ""explode"" (that is, they can tend to infinity), known as the vanishing gradient problem.
The long short term memory (LSTM) technique can prevent this in most cases.


=== Specialized languages and hardware ===

Specialized languages for artificial intelligence have been developed, such as Lisp, Prolog, TensorFlow and many others"
"Hardware developed for AI includes AI accelerators and neuromorphic computing.


== Applications ==

AI is relevant to any intellectual task.
Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here.
Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.In the 2010s, AI applications were at the heart of the most commercially successful areas of computing, and have become a ubiquitous feature of daily life"
"AI is used in search engines (such as Google Search),
targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon),
driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook),
virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars),
automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate),
facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace),
image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok)
, spam filtering and chatbots (such as Chat GPT).
There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve problems for specific industries or institutions"
"A few examples are energy storage, deepfakes, medical diagnosis, military logistics, foreign policy, or supply chain management.
Game playing has been a test of AI's strength since the 1950s"
"Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997"
"In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.
In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps"
"Other programs handle imperfect-information games; such as for poker at a superhuman level, Pluribus and Cepheus"
"DeepMind in the 2010s developed a ""generalized artificial intelligence"" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own.By 2020, natural language processing systems such as the enormous GPT-3 (then by far the largest artificial neural network) were matching human performance on pre-existing benchmarks, albeit without the system attaining a commonsense understanding of the contents of the benchmarks.
DeepMind's AlphaFold 2 (2020) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.
Other applications predict the result of judicial decisions, create art (such as poetry or painting) and prove mathematical theorems.
AI content detector tools are software applications that use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to analyze and detect specific types of content in digital media, such as text, images, and videos"
"These tools are commonly used to identify inappropriate content, such as speech errors, violent or sexual images, and spam, among others.
Some benefits of using AI content detector tools include improved efficiency and accuracy in detecting inappropriate content, increased safety and security for users, and reduced legal and reputational risks for websites and platforms.


=== Smart traffic lights ===

Smart traffic lights have been developed at Carnegie Mellon since 2009"
 Professor Stephen Smith has started a company since then Surtrac that has installed smart traffic control systems in 22 cities
" It costs about $20,000 per intersection to install"
"Drive time has been reduced by 25% and traffic jam waiting time has been reduced by 40% at the intersections it has been installed.


== Intellectual property ==

In 2019, WIPO reported that AI was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents, the Internet of things was estimated to be the largest in terms of market size"
"It was followed, again in market size, by big data technologies, robotics, AI, 3D printing and the fifth generation of mobile services (5G)"
"Since AI emerged in the 1950s, 340,000 AI-related patent applications were filed by innovators and 1.6 million scientific papers have been published by researchers, with the majority of all AI-related patent filings published since 2013"
"Companies represent 26 out of the top 30 AI patent applicants, with universities or public research organizations accounting for the remaining four"
"The ratio of scientific papers to inventions has significantly decreased from 8:1 in 2010 to 3:1 in 2016, which is attributed to be indicative of a shift from theoretical research to the use of AI technologies in commercial products and services"
"Machine learning is the dominant AI technique disclosed in patents and is included in more than one-third of all identified inventions (134,777 machine learning patents filed for a total of 167,038 AI patents filed in 2016), with computer vision being the most popular functional application"
"AI-related patents not only disclose AI techniques and applications, they often also refer to an application field or industry"
"Twenty application fields were identified in 2016 and included, in order of magnitude: telecommunications (15 percent), transportation (15 percent), life and medical sciences (12 percent), and personal devices, computing and human–computer interaction (11 percent)"
"Other sectors included banking, entertainment, security, industry and manufacturing, agriculture, and networks (including social networks, smart cities and the Internet of things)"
"IBM has the largest portfolio of AI patents with 8,290 patent applications, followed by Microsoft with 5,930 patent applications.


== Philosophy ==


=== Defining artificial intelligence ===

Alan Turing wrote in 1950 ""I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?""
He advised changing the question from whether a machine ""thinks"", to ""whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour"".
He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation"
"Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is ""actually"" thinking or literally has a ""mind"""
"Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but ""it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks""Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that AI must be defined in terms of ""acting"" and not ""thinking"""
"However, they are critical that the test compares machines to people"
"""Aeronautical engineering texts,"" they wrote, ""do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'"" AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that ""Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence"".McCarthy defines intelligence as ""the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world."" Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly defines it as ""the ability to solve hard problems"""
"These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the ""intelligence"" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.
A definition that has also been adopted by Google - major practitionary in the field of AI.
This definition stipulated the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.


=== Evaluating approaches to AI ===
No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history"
"The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term ""artificial intelligence"" to mean ""machine learning with neural networks"")"
"This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, neat, soft and narrow (see below)"
"Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.


==== Symbolic AI and its limits ====

Symbolic AI (or ""GOFAI"") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics"
"They were highly successful at ""intelligent"" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests"
"In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: ""A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.""However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning"
"Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level ""intelligent"" tasks were easy for AI, but low level ""instinctive"" tasks were extremely difficult.
Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a ""feel"" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.
Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree.The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias"
"Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision"
"The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.


==== Neat vs"
"scruffy ====

""Neats"" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks)"
"""Scruffies"" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems (especially in areas like common sense reasoning)"
"This issue was actively discussed in the 70s and 80s,
but in the 1990s mathematical methods and solid scientific standards became the norm, a transition that Russell and Norvig termed ""the victory of the neats"".


==== Soft vs"
"hard computing ====

Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems"
"Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation"
"Soft computing was introduced in the late 80s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.


==== Narrow vs"
"general AI ====

AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence (general AI) directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.
General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions"
"The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.


=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===

The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do"
"This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior"
Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field
"Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig observe that most AI researchers ""don't care about the [philosophy of AI] – as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence."" However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind"
"It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.


==== Consciousness ====

David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the ""hard"" and ""easy"" problems of consciousness"
"The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior"
The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all
"Human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain"
"For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.


==== Computationalism and functionalism ====

Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing"
Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind-body problem
"This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as ""strong AI"": ""The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.""
Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.


==== Robot rights ====

If a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have sentience (the ability to feel), and if so, then it could also suffer, and thus it would be entitled to certain rights.
Any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights.
This issue has been considered in fiction for centuries,
and is now being considered by, for example, California's Institute for the Future; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature.


== Future ==


=== Superintelligence ===

A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence, is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind"
"Superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself"
"The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to recursive self-improvement.
Its intelligence would increase exponentially in an intelligence explosion and could dramatically surpass humans"
"Science fiction writer Vernor Vinge named this scenario the ""singularity"".
Because it is difficult or impossible to know the limits of intelligence or the capabilities of superintelligent machines, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either"
"This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.Edward Fredkin argues that ""artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution"", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's ""Darwin among the Machines"" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.


=== Risks ===


==== Technological unemployment ====

In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that ""we're in uncharted territory"" with AI.
A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.
Subjective estimates of the risk vary widely; for example, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimate 47% of U.S"
"jobs are at ""high risk"" of potential automation, while an OECD report classifies only 9% of U.S"
"jobs as ""high risk"".Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist states that ""the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution"" is ""worth taking seriously"".
Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.


==== Bad actors and weaponized AI ====

AI provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for authoritarian governments: smart spyware, face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance; such surveillance allows machine learning to classify potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding; recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect; deepfakes aid in producing misinformation; advanced AI can make centralized decision making more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets.Terrorists, criminals and rogue states may use other forms of weaponized AI such as advanced digital warfare and lethal autonomous weapons"
"By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.Machine-learning AI is also able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.


==== Algorithmic bias ====

AI programs can become biased after learning from real-world data"
"It is not typically introduced by the system designers but is learned by the program, and thus the programmers are often unaware that the bias exists.
Bias can be inadvertently introduced by the way training data is selected.
It can also emerge from correlations: AI is used to classify individuals into groups and then make predictions assuming that the individual will resemble other members of the group"
"In some cases, this assumption may be unfair"
"An example of this is COMPAS, a commercial program widely used by U.S"
courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist
"ProPublica claims that the COMPAS-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is far more likely to be overestimated than that of white defendants, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants.Health equity issues may also be exacerbated when many-to-many mapping are done without taking steps to ensure equity for populations at risk for bias"
At this time equity-focused tools and regulations are not in place to ensure equity application representation and usage
"Other examples where algorithmic bias can lead to unfair outcomes are when AI is used for credit rating or hiring.
At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022) the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings recommending that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.


==== Existential risk ====

Superintelligent AI may be able to improve itself to the point that humans could not control it"
"This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking puts it, ""spell the end of the human race"""
"Philosopher Nick Bostrom argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down"
"If this AI's goals do not fully reflect humanity's, it might need to harm humanity to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal"
"He concludes that AI poses a risk to mankind, however humble or ""friendly"" its stated goals might be.
Political scientist Charles T"
"Rubin argues that ""any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence."" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would share our system of morality.The opinion of experts and industry insiders is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable AI.Stephen Hawking, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, history professor Yuval Noah Harari, and SpaceX founder Elon Musk have all expressed serious misgivings about the future of AI.
Prominent tech titans including Peter Thiel (Amazon Web Services) and Musk have committed more than $1 billion to nonprofit companies that champion responsible AI development, such as OpenAI and the Future of Life Institute.Mark Zuckerberg (CEO, Facebook) has said that artificial intelligence is helpful in its current form and will continue to assist humans.
Other experts argue is that the risks are far enough in the future to not be worth researching,
or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.Rodney Brooks, in particular, has said that ""malevolent"" AI is still centuries away.


==== Copyright ====
AI's decisions making abilities raises the questions of legal responsibility and copyright status of created works"
"This issues are being refined in various jurisdictions.


=== Ethical machines ===

Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans"
"Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions"
"The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.
Machine ethics is also called machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality,
and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's ""artificial moral agents""
and Stuart J"
"Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.


=== Regulation ===

The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.
The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.
Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.
Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, US and Vietnam"
"Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.
The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology"
"Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.


== In fiction ==

Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,
and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters"
This includes such works as Arthur C
"Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999)"
"In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the ""Multivac"" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name"
"Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;
while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.Transhumanism (the merging of humans and machines) is explored in the manga Ghost in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune.
Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer"
"This appears in Karel Čapek's R.U.R., the films A.I"
"Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K"
Dick
"Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.

(ed.)
"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
Artificial Intelligence"
"BBC Radio 4 discussion with John Agar, Alison Adam & Igor Aleksander (In Our Time, 8 December 2005)."
Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of computer science and engineering
"Robotics involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots"
The goal of robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans
"Robotics integrates fields of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, information engineering, mechatronics engineering, electronics, biomedical engineering, computer engineering, control systems engineering, software engineering, mathematics, etc.
Robotics develops machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions"
"Robots can be used in many situations for many purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including inspection of radioactive materials, bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g., in space, underwater, in high heat, and clean up and containment of hazardous materials and radiation)"
"Robots can take any form, but some are made to resemble humans in appearance"
This is claimed to help in the acceptance of robots in certain replicative behaviors which are usually performed by people
"Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, or any other tasks mainly performed by a human"
"Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.
Certain robots require user input to operate, while other robots function autonomously"
"The concept of creating robots that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century"
"Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in a human-like fashion"
"Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily"
"Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks"
"Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid.


== Etymology ==
The word robotics was derived from the word robot, which was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R"
"(Rossum's Universal Robots), which was published in 1920"
"The word robot comes from the Slavic word robota, which means work/job"
"The play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots, creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids"
Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word
"He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he named his brother Josef Čapek as its actual originator.According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word robotics was first used in print by Isaac Asimov, in his science fiction short story ""Liar!"", published in May 1941 in Astounding Science Fiction"
"Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term; since the science and technology of electrical devices is electronics, he assumed robotics already referred to the science and technology of robots"
"In some of Asimov's other works, he states that the first use of the word robotics was in his short story Runaround (Astounding Science Fiction, March 1942), where he introduced his concept of The Three Laws of Robotics"
"However, the original publication of ""Liar!"" predates that of ""Runaround"" by ten months, so the former is generally cited as the word's origin.


== History ==

In 1948, Norbert Wiener formulated the principles of cybernetics, the basis of practical robotics.
Fully autonomous robots only appeared in the second half of the 20th century"
"The first digitally operated and programmable robot, the Unimate, was installed in 1961 to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them"
"Commercial and industrial robots are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply, more accurately, and more reliably than humans"
"They are also employed in some jobs which are too dirty, dangerous, or dull to be suitable for humans"
"Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly, packing and packaging, mining, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, safety, and the mass production of consumer and industrial goods.


== Robotic aspects ==

There are many types of robots; they are used in many different environments and for many different uses"
"Although being very diverse in application and form, they all share three basic similarities when it comes to their construction:

Robots all have some kind of mechanical construction, a frame, form or shape designed to achieve a particular task"
"For example, a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud might use caterpillar tracks"
The mechanical aspect of the robot is mostly the creator's solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it
"Form follows function.
Robots have electrical components that power and control the machinery"
"For example, the robot with caterpillar tracks would need some kind of power to move the tracker treads"
"That power comes in the form of electricity, which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery, a basic electrical circuit"
"Even petrol-powered machines that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol-powered machines like cars, have batteries"
"The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status), and operation (robots need some level of electrical energy supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations)
All robots contain some level of computer programming code"
A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something
"In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not be able to go anywhere without a program telling it to move"
"Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly structured, its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all)"
"There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence, and hybrid"
"A robot with remote control programming has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with remote control"
It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics
"Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming"
"A hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions in them.


== Applications ==
As more and more robots are designed for specific tasks, this method of classification becomes more relevant"
"For example, many robots are designed for assembly work, which may not be readily adaptable for other applications"
"They are termed ""assembly robots"""
"For seam welding, some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot i.e"
"the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables, etc"
as an integrated unit
"Such an integrated robotic system is called a ""welding robot"" even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks"
"Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labeled as ""heavy-duty robots"".Current and potential applications include:

Military robots.
Industrial robots"
Robots are increasingly used in manufacturing (since the 1960s)
"According to the Robotic Industries Association US data, in 2016 the automotive industry was the main customer of industrial robots with 52% of total sales"
"In the auto industry, they can amount for more than half of the ""labor"""
"There are even ""lights off"" factories such as an IBM keyboard manufacturing factory in Texas that was fully automated as early as 2003.
Cobots (collaborative robots).
Construction robots"
"Construction robots can be separated into three types: traditional robots, robotic arm, and robotic exoskeleton.
Agricultural robots (AgRobots)"
The use of robots in agriculture is closely linked to the concept of AI-assisted precision agriculture and drone usage
"1996-1998 research also proved that robots can perform a herding task.
Medical robots of various types (such as da Vinci Surgical System and Hospi).
Kitchen automation"
"Commercial examples of kitchen automation are Flippy (burgers), Zume Pizza (pizza), Cafe X (coffee), Makr Shakr (cocktails), Frobot (frozen yogurts) and Sally (salads)"
"Home examples are Rotimatic (flatbreads baking) and Boris (dishwasher loading).
Robot combat for sport – hobby or sports event where two or more robots fight in an arena to disable each other"
"This has developed from a hobby in the 1990s to several TV series worldwide.
Cleanup of contaminated areas, such as toxic waste or nuclear facilities.
Domestic robots.
Nanorobots.
Swarm robotics.
Autonomous drones.
Sports field line marking.
Educational robotics"
" Robots such as LEGO® Mindstorms and Ozobots are used to teach coding, mathematics, and creative skills.


== Components ==


=== Power source ===

At present, mostly (lead–acid) batteries are used as a power source"
Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots
"They range from lead–acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver–cadmium batteries which are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive"
"Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime, and weight"
"Generators, often some type of internal combustion engine, can also be used"
"However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need fuel, require heat dissipation, and are relatively heavy"
A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely
This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere
"However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage"
"Potential power sources could be:

pneumatic (compressed gases)
Solar power (using the sun's energy and converting it into electrical power)
hydraulics (liquids)
flywheel energy storage
organic garbage (through anaerobic digestion)
nuclear


=== Actuation ===

Actuators are the ""muscles"" of a robot, the parts which convert stored energy into movement"
"By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories"
"There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air.


==== Electric motors ====

The vast majority of robots use electric motors, often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and CNC machines"
"These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational.


==== Linear actuators ====

Various types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning, and often have quicker direction changes, particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics"
They are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air (pneumatic actuator) or an oil (hydraulic actuator) Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew
"Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator that is turned by hand, such as a rack and pinion on a car.


==== Series elastic actuators ====
Series elastic actuation (SEA) relies on the idea of introducing intentional elasticity between the motor actuator and the load for robust force control"
"Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia, series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment (e.g., humans or workpieces) or during collisions"
" Furthermore, it also provides energy efficiency and shock absorption (mechanical filtering) while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components"
"This approach has successfully been employed in various robots, particularly advanced manufacturing robots and walking humanoid robots.The controller design of a series elastic actuator is most often performed within the passivity framework as it ensures the safety of interaction with unstructured environments"
"Despite its remarkable stability and robustness, this framework suffers from the stringent limitations imposed on the controller which may trade-off performance"
The reader is referred to the following survey which summarizes the common controller architectures for SEA along with the corresponding sufficient passivity conditions
"One recent study has derived the necessary and sufficient passivity conditions for one of the most common impedance control architectures, namely velocity-sourced SEA"
"This work is of particular importance as it drives the non-conservative passivity bounds in an SEA scheme for the first time which allows a larger selection of control gains.


==== Air muscles ====

Pneumatic artificial muscles also known as air muscles, are special tubes that expand (typically up to 42%) when air is forced inside them"
"They are used in some robot applications.


==== Wire muscles ====

Muscle wire, also known as shape memory alloy, Nitinol® or Flexinol® wire, is a material that contracts (under 5%) when electricity is applied"
"They have been used for some small robot applications.


==== Electroactive polymers ====

EAPs or EPAMs are a plastic material that can contract substantially (up to 380% activation strain) from electricity, and have been used in facial muscles and arms of humanoid robots, and to enable new robots to float, fly, swim or walk.


==== Piezo motors ====

Recent alternatives to DC motors are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors"
"These work on a fundamentally different principle, whereby tiny piezoceramic elements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion"
There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line
Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw
"The advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution, speed, and available force for their size"
"These motors are already available commercially, and being used on some robots.


==== Elastic nanotubes ====

Elastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in early-stage experimental development"
"The absence of defects in carbon nanotubes enables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent, with energy storage levels of perhaps 10 J/cm3 for metal nanotubes"
Human biceps could be replaced with an 8 mm diameter wire of this material
"Such compact ""muscle"" might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans.


=== Sensing ===

Sensors allow robots to receive information about a certain measurement of the environment, or internal components"
"This is essential for robots to perform their tasks, and act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response"
"They are used for various forms of measurements, to give the robots warnings about safety or malfunctions, and to provide real-time information about the task it is performing.


==== Touch ====

Current robotic and prosthetic hands receive far less tactile information than the human hand"
Recent research has developed a tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips
The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin
Electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core
"When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object"
"The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting the robotic grip on held objects.
Scientists from several European countries and Israel developed a prosthetic hand in 2009, called SmartHand, which functions like a real one—allowing patients to write with it, type on a keyboard, play piano and perform other fine movements"
"The prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feeling in its fingertips.


==== Vision ====

Computer vision is the science and technology of machines that see"
"As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images"
"The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences and views from cameras.
In most practical computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common.
Computer vision systems rely on image sensors that detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either visible light or infra-red light"
The sensors are designed using solid-state physics
The process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using optics
Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process
Robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment
"Like human eyes, robots' ""eyes"" must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest, and also adjust to variations in light intensities.
There is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological system, at different levels of complexity"
"Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision have a background in biology.


==== Other ====
Other common forms of sensing in robotics use lidar, radar, and sonar"
Lidar measures distance to a target by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor
"Radar uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects"
"Sonar uses sound propagation to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water.


=== Manipulation ===

A definition of robotic manipulation has been provided by Matt Mason as: ""manipulation refers to an agent’s control of its environment through selective contact”.Robots need to manipulate objects; pick up, modify, destroy, or otherwise have an effect"
"Thus the functional end of a robot arm intended to make the effect (whether a hand, or tool) are often referred to as end effectors, while the ""arm"" is referred to as a manipulator"
"Most robot arms have replaceable end-effectors, each allowing them to perform some small range of tasks"
"Some have a fixed manipulator that cannot be replaced, while a few have one very general-purpose manipulator, for example, a humanoid hand.


==== Mechanical grippers ====
One of the most common types of end-effectors are ""grippers"""
"In its simplest manifestation, it consists of just two fingers that can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects"
"Fingers can, for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire running through it"
Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand
Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand
"Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws"
Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction
"Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.


==== Suction end-effectors ====
Suction end-effectors, powered by vacuum generators, are very simple astrictive devices that can hold very large loads provided the prehension surface is smooth enough to ensure suction.
Pick and place robots for electronic components and for large objects like car windscreens, often use very simple vacuum end-effectors.
Suction is a highly used type of end-effector in industry, in part because the natural compliance of soft suction end-effectors can enable a robot to be more robust in the presence of imperfect robotic perception"
 As an example: consider the case of a robot vision system that estimates the position of a water bottle but has 1 centimeter of error
" While this may cause a rigid mechanical gripper to puncture the water bottle, the soft suction end-effector may just bend slightly and conform to the shape of the water bottle surface.


==== General purpose effectors ====
Some advanced robots are beginning to use fully humanoid hands, like the Shadow Hand, MANUS, and the Schunk hand"
"These are highly dexterous manipulators, with as many as 20 degrees of freedom and hundreds of tactile sensors.


=== Locomotion ===


==== Rolling robots ====

For simplicity, most mobile robots have four wheels or a number of continuous tracks"
Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels
"These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to.


===== Two-wheeled balancing robots =====
Balancing robots generally use a gyroscope to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum"
Many different balancing robots have been designed
"While the Segway is not commonly thought of as a robot, it can be thought of as a component of a robot, when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform)"
"An example of this use has been as NASA's Robonaut that has been mounted on a Segway.


===== One-wheeled balancing robots =====

A one-wheeled balancing robot is an extension of a two-wheeled balancing robot so that it can move in any 2D direction using a round ball as its only wheel"
"Several one-wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently, such as Carnegie Mellon University's ""Ballbot"" which is the approximate height and width of a person, and Tohoku Gakuin University's ""BallIP"""
"Because of the long, thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces, they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people.


===== Spherical orb robots =====

Several attempts have been made in robots that are completely inside a spherical ball, either by spinning a weight inside the ball, or by rotating the outer shells of the sphere"
"These have also been referred to as an orb bot or a ball bot.


===== Six-wheeled robots =====
Using six wheels instead of four wheels can give better traction or grip in outdoor terrain such as on rocky dirt or grass.


===== Tracked robots =====

Tank tracks provide even more traction than a six-wheeled robot"
"Tracked wheels behave as if they were made of hundreds of wheels, therefore are very common for outdoor and military robots, where the robot must drive on very rough terrain"
"However, they are difficult to use indoors such as on carpets and smooth floors"
"Examples include NASA's Urban Robot ""Urbie"".


==== Walking applied to robots ====

Walking is a difficult and dynamic problem to solve"
"Several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs, however, none have yet been made which are as robust as a human"
"There has been much study on human-inspired walking, such as AMBER lab which was established in 2008 by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University"
"Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs, due to these robots being significantly easier to construct"
"Walking robots can be used for uneven terrains, which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods"
"Typically, robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up stairs"
"None can walk over rocky, uneven terrain"
"Some of the methods which have been tried are:


===== ZMP technique =====

The zero moment point (ZMP) is the algorithm used by robots such as Honda's ASIMO"
"The robot's onboard computer tries to keep the total inertial forces (the combination of Earth's gravity and the acceleration and deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floor reaction force (the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot)"
"In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving no moment (force causing the robot to rotate and fall over)"
"However, this is not exactly how a human walks, and the difference is obvious to human observers, some of whom have pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the lavatory"
"ASIMO's walking algorithm is not static, and some dynamic balancing is used (see below)"
"However, it still requires a smooth surface to walk on.


===== Hopping =====
Several robots, built in the 1980s by Marc Raibert at the MIT Leg Laboratory, successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking"
"Initially, a robot with only one leg, and a very small foot could stay upright simply by hopping"
The movement is the same as that of a person on a pogo stick
"As the robot falls to one side, it would jump slightly in that direction, in order to catch itself"
"Soon, the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs"
A bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performing somersaults
"A quadruped was also demonstrated which could trot, run, pace, and bound"
"For a full list of these robots, see the MIT Leg Lab Robots page.


===== Dynamic balancing (controlled falling) =====
A more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm, which is potentially more robust than the Zero Moment Point technique, as it constantly monitors the robot's motion, and places the feet in order to maintain stability"
"This technique was recently demonstrated by Anybots' Dexter Robot, which is so stable, it can even jump"
"Another example is the TU Delft Flame.


===== Passive dynamics =====

Perhaps the most promising approach uses passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency"
"It has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only gravity to propel themselves"
"Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a hill"
"This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.


==== Other methods of locomotion ====


===== Flying =====
A modern passenger airliner is essentially a flying robot, with two humans to manage it"
"The autopilot can control the plane for each stage of the journey, including takeoff, normal flight, and even landing"
Other flying robots are uninhabited and are known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
"They can be smaller and lighter without a human pilot on board, and fly into dangerous territory for military surveillance missions"
Some can even fire on targets under command
"UAVs are also being developed which can fire on targets automatically, without the need for a command from a human"
"Other flying robots include cruise missiles, the Entomopter, and the Epson micro helicopter robot"
"Robots such as the Air Penguin, Air Ray, and Air Jelly have lighter-than-air bodies, are propelled by paddles, and are guided by sonar.


===== Snaking =====

Several snake robots have been successfully developed"
"Mimicking the way real snakes move, these robots can navigate very confined spaces, meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings"
"The Japanese ACM-R5 snake robot can even navigate both on land and in water.


===== Skating =====
A small number of skating robots have been developed, one of which is a multi-mode walking and skating device"
"It has four legs, with unpowered wheels, which can either step or roll"
"Another robot, Plen, can use a miniature skateboard or roller-skates, and skate across a desktop.


===== Climbing =====
Several different approaches have been used to develop robots that have the ability to climb vertical surfaces"
One approach mimics the movements of a human climber on a wall with protrusions; adjusting the center of mass and moving each limb in turn to gain leverage
"An example of this is Capuchin, built by Dr"
"Ruixiang Zhang at Stanford University, California"
"Another approach uses the specialized toe pad method of wall-climbing geckoes, which can run on smooth surfaces such as vertical glass"
"Examples of this approach include Wallbot and Stickybot.China's Technology Daily reported on 15 November 2008, that Dr"
"Li Hiu Yeung and his research group of New Concept Aircraft (Zhuhai) Co., Ltd"
"had successfully developed a bionic gecko robot named ""Speedy Freelander"""
According to Dr
"Yeung, the gecko robot could rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls, navigate through ground and wall fissures, and walk upside-down on the ceiling"
"It was also able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass, rough, sticky or dusty walls as well as various types of metallic materials"
It could also identify and circumvent obstacles automatically
Its flexibility and speed were comparable to a natural gecko
"A third approach is to mimic the motion of a snake climbing a pole.


===== Swimming (Piscine) =====
It is calculated that when swimming some fish can achieve a propulsive efficiency greater than 90%"
"Furthermore, they can accelerate and maneuver far better than any man-made boat or submarine, and produce less noise and water disturbance"
"Therefore, many researchers studying underwater robots would like to copy this type of locomotion"
"Notable examples are the Essex University Computer Science Robotic Fish G9, and the Robot Tuna built by the Institute of Field Robotics, to analyze and mathematically model thunniform motion"
"The Aqua Penguin, designed and built by Festo of Germany, copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front ""flippers"" of penguins"
"Festo have also built the Aqua Ray and Aqua Jelly, which emulate the locomotion of manta ray, and jellyfish, respectively.

In 2014 iSplash-II was developed by PhD student Richard James Clapham and Prof"
Huosheng Hu at Essex University
"It was the first robotic fish capable of outperforming real carangiform fish in terms of average maximum velocity (measured in body lengths/ second) and endurance, the duration that top speed is maintained"
This build attained swimming speeds of 11.6BL/s (i.e
3.7 m/s)
"The first build, iSplash-I (2014) was the first robotic platform to apply a full-body length carangiform swimming motion which was found to increase swimming speed by 27% over the traditional approach of a posterior confined waveform.


===== Sailing =====

Sailboat robots have also been developed in order to make measurements at the surface of the ocean"
A typical sailboat robot is Vaimos built by IFREMER and ENSTA-Bretagne
"Since the propulsion of sailboat robots uses the wind, the energy of the batteries is only used for the computer, for the communication and for the actuators (to tune the rudder and the sail)"
"If the robot is equipped with solar panels, the robot could theoretically navigate forever"
"The two main competitions of sailboat robots are WRSC, which takes place every year in Europe, and Sailbot.


=== Environmental interaction and navigation ===

Though a significant percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment, there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment"
These robots require some combination of navigation hardware and software in order to traverse their environment
"In particular, unforeseen events (e.g"
people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions
Some highly advanced robots such as ASIMO and Meinü robot have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software
"Also, self-controlled cars, Ernst Dickmanns' driverless car, and the entries in the DARPA Grand Challenge, are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information, including by a swarm of autonomous robots"
"Most of these robots employ a GPS navigation device with waypoints, along with radar, sometimes combined with other sensory data such as lidar, video cameras, and inertial guidance systems for better navigation between waypoints.


=== Human-robot interaction ===

The state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors"
"If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance"
"The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive"
"Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface"
"Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot"
"It will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation"
"Even though the current state of robotics cannot meet the standards of these robots from science-fiction, robotic media characters (e.g., Wall-E, R2-D2) can elicit audience sympathies that increase people's willingness to accept actual robots in the future"
Acceptance of social robots is also likely to increase if people can meet a social robot under appropriate conditions
"Studies have shown that interacting with a robot by looking at, touching, or even imagining interacting with the robot can reduce negative feelings that some people have about robots before interacting with them"
"However, if pre-existing negative sentiments are especially strong, interacting with a robot can increase those negative feelings towards robots.


==== Speech recognition ====

Interpreting the continuous flow of sounds coming from a human, in real time, is a difficult task for a computer, mostly because of the great variability of speech"
"The same word, spoken by the same person may sound different depending on local acoustics, volume, the previous word, whether or not the speaker has a cold, etc."
It becomes even harder when the speaker has a different accent
"Nevertheless, great strides have been made in the field since Davis, Biddulph, and Balashek designed the first ""voice input system"" which recognized ""ten digits spoken by a single user with 100% accuracy"" in 1952"
"Currently, the best systems can recognize continuous, natural speech, up to 160 words per minute, with an accuracy of 95%"
"With the help of artificial intelligence, machines nowadays can use people's voice to identify their emotions such as satisfied or angry.


==== Robotic voice ====
Other hurdles exist when allowing the robot to use voice for interacting with humans"
"For social reasons, synthetic voice proves suboptimal as a communication medium, making it necessary to develop the emotional component of robotic voice through various techniques"
"An advantage of diphonic branching is the emotion that the robot is programmed to project, can be carried on the voice tape, or phoneme, already pre-programmed onto the voice media"
One of the earliest examples is a teaching robot named Leachim developed in 1974 by Michael J
Freeman
Leachim was able to convert digital memory to rudimentary verbal speech on pre-recorded computer discs
"It was programmed to teach students in The Bronx, New York.


==== Gestures ====

One can imagine, in the future, explaining to a robot chef how to make a pastry, or asking directions from a robot police officer"
"In both of these cases, making hand gestures would aid the verbal descriptions"
"In the first case, the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human, and perhaps repeating them for confirmation"
"In the second case, the robot police officer would gesture to indicate ""down the road, then turn right"""
It is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots
"A great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures.


==== Facial expression ====

Facial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots"
"Robotic faces have been constructed by Hanson Robotics using their elastic polymer called Frubber, allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors (servos)"
The coating and servos are built on a metal skull
"A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and body language"
"Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot"
"Likewise, robots like Kismet and the more recent addition, Nexi can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.


==== Artificial emotions ====
Artificial emotions can also be generated, composed of a sequence of facial expressions or gestures"
"As can be seen from the movie Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation"
"To simplify this programming in the movie, presets were created together with a special software program"
This decreased the amount of time needed to make the film
These presets could possibly be transferred for use in real-life robots
"An example of a robot with artificial emotions is Robin the Robot developed by an Armenian IT company Expper Technologies, which uses AI-based peer-to-peer interaction"
"Its main task is achieving emotional well-being, i.e"
overcome stress and anxiety
Robin was trained to analyze facial expressions and use his face to display his emotions given the context
"The robot has been tested by kids in US clinics, and observations show that Robin increased the appetite and cheerfulness of children after meeting and talking.


==== Personality ====
Many of the robots of science fiction have a personality, something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future"
"Nevertheless, researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality: i.e"
"they use sounds, facial expressions, and body language to try to convey an internal state, which may be joy, sadness, or fear"
"One commercial example is Pleo, a toy robot dinosaur, which can exhibit several apparent emotions.


==== Social intelligence ====
The Socially Intelligent Machines Lab of the Georgia Institute of Technology researches new concepts of guided teaching interaction with robots"
The aim of the projects is a social robot that learns task and goals from human demonstrations without prior knowledge of high-level concepts
"These new concepts are grounded from low-level continuous sensor data through unsupervised learning, and task goals are subsequently learned using a Bayesian approach"
"These concepts can be used to transfer knowledge to future tasks, resulting in faster learning of those tasks"
"The results are demonstrated by the robot Curi who can scoop some pasta from a pot onto a plate and serve the sauce on top.


== Control ==

The mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks"
"The control of a robot involves three distinct phases – perception, processing, and action (robotic paradigms)"
Sensors give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g
the position of its joints or its end effector)
"This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators (motors), which move the mechanical structure to achieve the required co-ordinated motion or force actions.
The processing phase can range in complexity"
"At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands (e.g"
firing motor power electronic gates based directly upon encoder feedback signals to achieve the required torque/velocity of the shaft)
Sensor fusion and internal models may first be used to estimate parameters of interest (e.g
the position of the robot's gripper) from noisy sensor data
An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction until an object is detected with a proximity sensor) is sometimes inferred from these estimates
"Techniques from control theory are generally used to convert the higher-level tasks into individual commands that drive the actuators, most often using kinematic and dynamic models of the mechanical structure.At longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a ""cognitive"" model"
"Cognitive models try to represent the robot, the world, and how the two interact"
Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects
Mapping techniques can be used to build maps of the world
"Finally, motion planning and other artificial intelligence techniques may be used to figure out how to act"
"For example, a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles, falling over, etc.
Modern commercial robotic control systems are highly complex, integrate multiple sensors and effectors, have many interacting degrees-of-freedom (DOF) and require operator interfaces, programming tools and real-time capabilities"
They are oftentimes interconnected to wider communication networks and in many cases are now both IoT-enabled and mobile
"Progress towards open architecture, layered, user-friendly and ‘intelligent’ sensor-based interconnected robots has emerged from earlier concepts related to Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS), and several 'open or 'hybrid' reference architectures exist which assist developers of robot control software and hardware to move beyond traditional, earlier notions of 'closed' robot control systems have been proposed"
"Open architecture controllers are said to be better able to meet the growing requirements of a wide range of robot users, including system developers, end users and research scientists, and are better positioned to deliver the advanced robotic concepts related to Industry 4.0"
"In addition to utilizing many established features of robot controllers, such as position, velocity and force control of end effectors, they also enable IoT interconnection and the implementation of more advanced sensor fusion and control techniques, including adaptive control, Fuzzy control and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based control"
"When implemented in real-time, such techniques can potentially improve the stability and performance of robots operating in unknown or uncertain environments by enabling the control systems to learn and adapt to environmental changes"
"There are several examples of reference architectures for robot controllers, and also examples of successful implementations of actual robot controllers developed from them"
"One example of a generic reference architecture and associated interconnected, open-architecture robot and controller implementation was developed by Michael Short and colleagues at the University of Sunderland in the UK in 2000 (pictured right)"
"The robot was used in a number of research and development studies, including prototype implementation of novel advanced and intelligent control and environment mapping methods in real-time.


=== Autonomy levels ===

Control systems may also have varying levels of autonomy.

Direct interaction is used for haptic or teleoperated devices, and the human has nearly complete control over the robot's motion.
Operator-assist modes have the operator commanding medium-to-high-level tasks, with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them.
An autonomous robot may go without human interaction for extended periods of time "
Higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex cognitive capabilities
"For example, robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous but operate in a fixed pattern.Another classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions.

Teleoperation"
"A human controls each movement, each machine actuator change is specified by the operator.
Supervisory"
"A human specifies general moves or position changes and the machine decides specific movements of its actuators.
Task-level autonomy"
"The operator specifies only the task and the robot manages itself to complete it.
Full autonomy"
"The machine will create and complete all its tasks without human interaction.


== Research ==

Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into new types of robots, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them"
"Other investigations, such as MIT's cyberflora project, are almost wholly academic.
A first particular new innovation in robot design is the open sourcing of robot-projects"
"To describe the level of advancement of a robot, the term ""Generation Robots"" can be used"
"This term is coined by Professor Hans Moravec, Principal Research Scientist at the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute in describing the near future evolution of robot technology"
"First-generation robots, Moravec predicted in 1997, should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a lizard and should become available by 2010"
"Because the first generation robot would be incapable of learning, however, Moravec predicts that the second generation robot would be an improvement over the first and become available by 2020, with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of a mouse"
The third generation robot should have intelligence comparable to that of a monkey
"Though fourth generation robots, robots with human intelligence, professor Moravec predicts, would become possible, he does not predict this happening before around 2040 or 2050.The second is evolutionary robots"
"This is a methodology that uses evolutionary computation to help design robots, especially the body form, or motion and behavior controllers"
"In a similar way to natural evolution, a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way, or their ability to perform a task is measured using a fitness function"
"Those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set, which have new behaviors based on those of the winners"
"Over time the population improves, and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear"
This happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers
"Researchers use this method both to create better robots, and to explore the nature of evolution"
"Because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated, this technique may be run entirely or mostly in simulation, using a robot simulator software package, then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough"
"Currently, there are about 10 million industrial robots toiling around the world, and Japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry.


=== Dynamics and kinematics ===

The study of motion can be divided into kinematics and dynamics"
"Direct kinematics or forward kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known"
"Inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning"
"Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), collision avoidance, and singularity avoidance"
"Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using kinematics, methods from the field of dynamics are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements"
Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known
Direct dynamics is used in computer simulations of the robot
Inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration
"This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.
In each area mentioned above, researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies, improve existing ones, and improve the interaction between these areas"
"To do this, criteria for ""optimal"" performance and ways to optimize design, structure, and control of robots must be developed and implemented.


=== Bionics and biomimetics ===
Bionics and biomimetics apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots"
" For example, the design of BionicKangaroo was based on the way kangaroos jump.


=== Quantum computing ===
There has been some research into whether robotics algorithms can be run more quickly on quantum computers than they can be run on digital computers"
"This area has been referred to as quantum robotics.


== Education and training ==

Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics"
"Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, particularly in parts of the USA, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence, and robotics among students.


== Employment ==

Robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing environments"
"As factories increase their use of robots, the number of robotics–related jobs grow and have been observed to be steadily rising"
The employment of robots in industries has increased productivity and efficiency savings and is typically seen as a long-term investment for benefactors
"A paper by Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey found that 47 percent of US jobs are at risk to automation ""over some unspecified number of years"""
"These claims have been criticized on the ground that social policy, not AI, causes unemployment"
"In a 2016 article in The Guardian, Stephen Hawking stated ""The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining"".According to a GlobalData September 2021 report, the robotics industry was worth $45bn in 2020, and by 2030, it will have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% to $568bn, driving jobs in robotics and related industries.


== Occupational safety and health implications ==

A discussion paper drawn up by EU-OSHA highlights how the spread of robotics presents both opportunities and challenges for occupational safety and health (OSH).The greatest OSH benefits stemming from the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments"
"In space, defense, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance, and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers' exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks"
"For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres"
"In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.Moreover, there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills"
"The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility, and adaptability"
"This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the ""man-robot merger"""
Some European countries are including robotics in their national programs and trying to promote a safe and flexible cooperation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity
"For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) organises annual workshops on the topic ""human-robot collaboration"".
In the future, cooperation between robots and humans will be diversified, with robots increasing their autonomy and human-robot collaboration reaching completely new forms"
"Current approaches and technical standards aiming to protect employees from the risk of working with collaborative robots will have to be revised.


== User experience ==
Great user experience predicts the needs, experiences, behaviors, language and cognitive abilities, and other factors of each user group"
It then uses these insights to produce a product or solution that is ultimately useful and usable
"For robots, user experience begins with an understanding of the robot's intended task and environment, while considering any possible social impact the robot may have on human operations and interactions with it.It defines that communication as the transmission of information through signals, which are elements perceived through touch, sound, smell and sight"
"The author states that the signal connects the sender to the receiver and consists of three parts: the signal itself, what it refers to, and the interpreter"
"Body postures and gestures, facial expressions, hand and head movements are all part of nonverbal behavior and communication"
Robots are no exception when it comes to human-robot interaction
"Therefore, humans use their verbal and nonverbal behaviors to communicate their defining characteristics"
"Similarly, social robots need this coordination to perform human-like behaviors.

A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes
"Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves)"
The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created
"Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it"
"Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks"
"Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W"
"Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer"
The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server
The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies
The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.Private blockchains have been proposed for business use
"Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model ""snake oil""; however, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.


== History ==

Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation ""Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."" Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W"
Scott Stornetta
They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with
"In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block"
"Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008"
Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain
"The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes)"
"In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size"
" The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase"
"Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.
In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term ""planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain"""
"For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a 'game-changer' for their business.


== Structure and design ==

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks"
This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively
A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server
They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests
Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal
The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset
"It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending"
A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol
"A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:
infrastructure (hardware)
networking (node discovery, information propagation and verification)
consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)
data (blocks, transactions)
application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)


=== Blocks ===
Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree"
"Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two"
The linked blocks form a chain
"This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the genesis block (Block 0)"
"To assure the integrity of a block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork"
"In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others"
Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks
Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time
They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them
Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers
There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever
Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks
"Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.: ch"
"08  For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network"
There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation
"Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel manner.


==== Block time ====
The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain"
"By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable"
"In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions"
"The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.


==== Hard forks ====


=== Decentralization ===
By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates some risks that come with data being held centrally"
"The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking.In a  so-called ""51% attack"" a central entity gains control of more than half of a network and can then manipulate that specific blockchain record at will, allowing double-spending.Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography.: 5  A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain"
Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address
A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support
Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain
Data quality is maintained by massive database replication and computational trust
"No centralized ""official"" copy exists and no user is ""trusted"" more than any other"
Transactions are broadcast to the network using the software
Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis
"Early blockchains rely on energy-intensive mining nodes to validate transactions, add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes.: ch"
"08  Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes"
Later consensus methods include proof of stake
"The growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.


==== Finality ====
Finality is the level of confidence that the well-formed block recently appended to the blockchain will not be revoked in the future (is ""finalized"") and thus can be trusted"
"Most distributed blockchain protocols, whether proof of work or proof of stake, cannot guarantee the finality of a freshly committed block, and instead rely on ""probabilistic finality"": as the block goes deeper into a blockchain, it is less likely to be altered or reverted by a newly found consensus.Byzantine Fault Tolerance-based proof-of-stake protocols purport to provide so called ""absolute finality"": a randomly chosen validator proposes a block, the rest of validators vote on it, and, if a supermajority decision approves it, the block is irreversibly committed into the blockchain"
"A modification of this method, an ""economic finality"", is used in practical protocols, like the Casper protocol used in Ethereum: validators which sign two different blocks at the same position in the blockchain are subject to ""slashing"", where their leveraged stake is forfeited.


=== Openness ===
Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view"
"Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition"
An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain
"Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term ""blockchain"" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks"
These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases
"Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.: 30–31  Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision"
"Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that ""many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases,"" and ""without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion.""


==== Permissionless (public) blockchain ====
An advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed"
"This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include proof of work"
"To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles"
"While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper ""Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail"".
In 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China"
Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains
"As of April 2018, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.


==== Permissioned (private) blockchain ====

Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network"
"It has been argued that permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of decentralization, if carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless blockchains, which are often centralized in practice.


===== Disadvantages of permissioned blockchain =====
Nikolai Hampton argued in Computerworld that ""There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources"
"If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."" This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis like the financial crisis of 2007–08, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others, and ""the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort"
"It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it's time-consuming and expensive."" He also said, ""Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors"
"This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases.""


==== Blockchain analysis ====
The analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with the popularity of bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies"
"A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who wants access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the know-how"
"The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges and banks"
"The reason for this is accusations of blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies enabling illicit dark market trade of drugs, weapons, money laundering, etc"
"A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes"
"This is changing and now specialised tech companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges, law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat-crypto exchanges"
"The development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise the use of new cryptos such as Monero"
The question is about the public accessibility of blockchain data and the personal privacy of the very same data
"It is a key debate in cryptocurrency and ultimately in the blockchain.


=== Standardisation ===
In April 2016, Standards Australia submitted a proposal to the International Organization for Standardization to consider developing standards to support blockchain technology"
"This proposal resulted in the creation of ISO Technical Committee 307, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies"
"The technical committee has working groups relating to blockchain terminology, reference architecture, security and privacy, identity, smart contracts, governance and interoperability for blockchain and DLT, as well as standards specific to industry sectors and generic government requirements"
"More than 50 countries are participating in the standardization process together with external liaisons such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the European Commission, the International Federation of Surveyors, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).Many other national standards bodies and open standards bodies are also working on blockchain standards"
" These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and some individual participants in the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).


=== Centralized blockchain ===
Although most of blockchain implementation are decentralized and distributed, Oracle launched a centralized blockchain table feature in Oracle 21c database"
 The Blockchain Table in Oracle 21c database is a centralized blockchain which provide immutable feature
" Compared to decentralized blockchains, centralized blockchains normally can provide a higher throughput and lower latency of transactions than consensus-based distributed blockchains.


== Types ==
Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains.


=== Public blockchains ===
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions"
"Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol)"
"Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.
Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.


=== Private blockchains ===
A private blockchain is permissioned"
One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators
Participant and validator access is restricted
"To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.


=== Hybrid blockchains ===
A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features"
"The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization and decentralization are used.


=== Sidechains ===
A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain"
"Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent digital assets) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate consensus algorithm, etc.).


=== Consortium blockchain ===
A consortium blockchain is a type of blockchain that combines elements of both public and private blockchains"
"In a consortium blockchain, a group of organizations come together to create and operate the blockchain, rather than a single entity"
The consortium members jointly manage the blockchain network and are responsible for validating transactions
"Consortium blockchains are permissioned, meaning that only certain individuals or organizations are allowed to participate in the network"
"This allows for greater control over who can access the blockchain and helps to ensure that sensitive information is kept confidential.
Consortium blockchains are commonly used in industries where multiple organizations need to collaborate on a common goal, such as supply chain management or financial services"
"One advantage of consortium blockchains is that they can be more efficient and scalable than public blockchains, as the number of nodes required to validate transactions is typically smaller"
"Additionally, consortium blockchains can provide greater security and reliability than private blockchains, as the consortium members work together to maintain the network"
"Some examples of consortium blockchains include Quorum and Hyperledger.


== Uses ==

Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas"
The primary use of blockchains is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin; there were also a few other operational products that had matured from proof of concept by late 2016
"As of 2016, some businesses have been testing the technology and conducting low-level implementation to gauge blockchain's effects on organizational efficiency in their back office.In 2019, it was estimated that around $2.9 billion were invested in blockchain technology, which represents an 89% increase from the year prior"
"Additionally, the International Data Corp has estimated that corporate investment into blockchain technology will reach $12.4 billion by 2022"
"Furthermore, According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the second-largest professional services network in the world, blockchain technology has the potential to generate an annual business value of more than $3 trillion by 2030"
"PwC's estimate is further augmented by a 2018 study that they have conducted, in which PwC surveyed 600 business executives and determined that 84% have at least some exposure to utilizing blockchain technology, which indicates a significant demand and interest in blockchain technology.In 2019 the BBC World Service radio and podcast series Fifty Things That Made the Modern Economy identified blockchain as a technology that would have far-reaching consequences for economics and society"
The economist and Financial Times journalist and broadcaster Tim Harford discussed why the underlying technology might have much wider applications and the challenges that needed to be overcome
"First broadcast 29 June 2019.
The number of blockchain wallets quadrupled to 40 million between 2016 and 2020.A paper published in 2022 discussed the potential use of blockchain technology in sustainable management


=== Cryptocurrencies ===

Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions"
"For example, the bitcoin network and Ethereum network are both based on blockchain.
The criminal enterprise Silk Road, which operated on Tor, utilized cryptocurrency for payments, some of which the US federal government has seized through research on the blockchain and forfeiture.Governments have mixed policies on the legality of their citizens or banks owning cryptocurrencies"
China implements blockchain technology in several industries including a national digital currency which launched in 2020
"To strengthen their respective currencies, Western governments including the European Union and the United States have initiated similar projects.


=== Smart contracts ===

Blockchain-based smart contracts are proposed contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction"
One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow
A key feature of smart contracts is that they do not need a trusted third party (such as a trustee) to act as an intermediary between contracting entities — the blockchain network executes the contract on its own
This may reduce friction between entities when transferring value and could subsequently open the door to a higher level of transaction automation
An IMF staff discussion from 2018 reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general
"But ""no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged."" Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status was unclear.


=== Financial services ===
According to Reason, many banks have expressed interest in implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking and are cooperating with companies creating private blockchains, and according to a September 2016 IBM study, this is occurring faster than expected.Banks are interested in this technology not least because it has the potential to speed up back office settlement systems"
"Moreover, as the blockchain industry has reached early maturity institutional appreciation has grown that it is, practically speaking, the infrastructure of a whole new financial industry, with all the implications which that entails.Banks such as UBS are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore how blockchain can be used in financial services to increase efficiency and reduce costs.Berenberg, a German bank, believes that blockchain is an ""overhyped technology"" that has had a large number of ""proofs of concept"", but still has major challenges, and very few success stories.The blockchain has also given rise to initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as a new category of digital asset called security token offerings (STOs), also sometimes referred to as digital security offerings (DSOs)"
"STO/DSOs may be conducted privately or on public, regulated stock exchange and are used to tokenize traditional assets such as company shares as well as more innovative ones like intellectual property, real estate, art, or individual products"
"A number of companies are active in this space providing services for compliant tokenization, private STOs, and public STOs.


=== Games ===

Blockchain technology, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has been used in video games for monetization"
"Many live-service games offer in-game customization options, such as character skins or other in-game items, which the players can earn and trade with other players using in-game currency"
"Some games also allow for trading of virtual items using real-world currency, but this may be illegal in some countries where video games are seen as akin to gambling, and has led to gray market issues such as skin gambling, and thus publishers typically have shied away from allowing players to earn real-world funds from games"
"Blockchain games typically allow players to trade these in-game items for cryptocurrency, which can then be exchanged for money.The first known game to use blockchain technologies was CryptoKitties, launched in November 2017, where the player would purchase NFTs with Ethereum cryptocurrency, each NFT consisting of a virtual pet that the player could breed with others to create offspring with combined traits as new NFTs"
"The game made headlines in December 2017 when one virtual pet sold for more than US$100,000"
"CryptoKitties also illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network in early 2018 with approximately 30% of all Ethereum transactions being for the game.By the early 2020s, there had not been a breakout success in video games using blockchain, as these games tend to focus on using blockchain for speculation instead of more traditional forms of gameplay, which offers limited appeal to most players"
Such games also represent a high risk to investors as their revenues can be difficult to predict
"However, limited successes of some games, such as Axie Infinity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and corporate plans towards metaverse content, refueled interest in the area of GameFi, a term describing the intersection of video games and financing typically backed by blockchain currency, in the second half of 2021"
"Several major publishers, including Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, and Take Two Interactive, have stated that blockchain and NFT-based games are under serious consideration for their companies in the future.In October 2021, Valve Corporation banned blockchain games, including those using cryptocurrency and NFTs, from being hosted on its Steam digital storefront service, which is widely used for personal computer gaming, claiming that this was an extension of their policy banning games that offered in-game items with real-world value"
"Valve's prior history with gambling, specifically skin gambling, was speculated to be a factor in the decision to ban blockchain games"
"Journalists and players responded positively to Valve's decision as blockchain and NFT games have a reputation for scams and fraud among most PC gamers, Epic Games, which runs the Epic Games Store in competition to Steam, said that they would be open to accepted blockchain games in the wake of Valve's refusal.


=== Supply chain ===
There have been several different efforts to employ blockchains in supply chain management.

Precious commodities mining — Blockchain technology has been used for tracking the origins of gemstones and other precious commodities"
"In 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that the blockchain technology company Everledger was partnering with IBM's blockchain-based tracking service to trace the origin of diamonds to ensure that they were ethically mined"
"As of 2019, the Diamond Trading Company (DTC) has been involved in building a diamond trading supply chain product called Tracr.
Food supply — As of 2018, Walmart and IBM were running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for supply chain monitoring for lettuce and spinach — all nodes of the blockchain were administered by Walmart and were located on the IBM cloud.
Fashion industry — There is an opaque relationship between brands, distributors, and customers in the fashion industry, which will prevent the sustainable and stable development of the fashion industry"
"Blockchain makes up for this shortcoming and makes information transparent, solving the difficulty of sustainable development of the industry.


=== Domain names ===
There are several different efforts to offer domain name services via the blockchain"
"These domain names can be controlled by the use of a private key, which purports to allow for uncensorable websites"
"This would also bypass a registrar's ability to suppress domains used for fraud, abuse, or illegal content.Namecoin is a cryptocurrency that supports the "".bit"" top-level domain (TLD)"
Namecoin was forked from bitcoin in 2011
"The .bit TLD is not sanctioned by ICANN, instead requiring an alternative DNS root"
"As of 2015, .bit was used by 28 websites, out of 120,000 registered names"
"Namecoin was dropped by OpenNIC in 2019, due to malware and potential other legal issues"
"Other blockchain alternatives to ICANN include The Handshake Network, EmerDNS, and Unstoppable Domains.Specific TLDs include "".eth"", "".luxe"", and "".kred"", which are associated with the Ethereum blockchain through the Ethereum Name Service (ENS)"
"The .kred TLD also acts as an alternative to conventional cryptocurrency wallet addresses as a convenience for transferring cryptocurrency.


=== Other uses ===
Blockchain technology can be used to create a permanent, public, transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wireless users or musicians"
The Gartner 2019 CIO Survey reported 2% of higher education respondents had launched blockchain projects and another 18% were planning academic projects in the next 24 months
"In 2017, IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to adopt blockchain technology in music distribution"
"Imogen Heap's Mycelia service has also been proposed as a blockchain-based alternative ""that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians.""New distribution methods are available for the insurance industry such as peer-to-peer insurance, parametric insurance and microinsurance following the adoption of blockchain"
The sharing economy and IoT are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating peers
The use of blockchain in libraries is being studied with a grant from the U.S
"Institute of Museum and Library Services.Other blockchain designs include Hyperledger, a collaborative effort from the Linux Foundation to support blockchain-based distributed ledgers, with projects under this initiative including Hyperledger Burrow (by Monax) and Hyperledger Fabric (spearheaded by IBM)"
"Another is Quorum, a permissioned private blockchain by JPMorgan Chase with private storage, used for contract applications.Oracle introduced a blockchain table feature in its Oracle 21c database.Blockchain is also being used in peer-to-peer energy trading.Blockchain could be used in detecting counterfeits by associating unique identifiers to products, documents and shipments, and storing records associated with transactions that cannot be forged or altered"
It is however argued that blockchain technology needs to be supplemented with technologies that provide a strong binding between physical objects and blockchain systems
"The EUIPO established an Anti-Counterfeiting Blockathon Forum, with the objective of ""defining, piloting and implementing"" an anti-counterfeiting infrastructure at the European level"
"The Dutch Standardisation organisation NEN uses blockchain together with QR Codes to authenticate certificates.2022 Jan 30 Beijing and Shanghai are among the cities designated by China to trial blockchain applications.


== Blockchain interoperability ==
With the increasing number of blockchain systems appearing, even only those that support cryptocurrencies, blockchain interoperability is becoming a topic of major importance"
The objective is to support transferring assets from one blockchain system to another blockchain system
"Wegner stated that ""interoperability is the ability of two or more software components to cooperate despite differences in language, interface, and execution platform"""
"The objective of blockchain interoperability is therefore to support such cooperation among blockchain systems, despite those kinds of differences.
There are already several blockchain interoperability solutions available"
"They can be classified into three categories: cryptocurrency interoperability approaches, blockchain engines, and blockchain connectors.
Several individual IETF participants produced the draft of a blockchain interoperability architecture.


== Energy consumption concerns ==
Some cryptocurrencies use blockchain mining — the peer-to-peer computer computations by which transactions are validated and verified"
This requires a large amount of energy
"In June 2018, the Bank for International Settlements criticized the use of public proof-of-work blockchains for their high energy consumption.Early concern over the high energy consumption was a factor in later blockchains such as Cardano (2017), Solana (2020) and Polkadot (2020) adopting the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake model"
"Researchers have estimated that Bitcoin consumes 100,000 times as much energy as proof-of-stake networks.In 2021, a study by Cambridge University determined that Bitcoin (at 121 terawatt-hours per year) used more electricity than Argentina (at 121TWh) and the Netherlands (109TWh)"
"According to Digiconomist, one bitcoin transaction required 708 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy, the amount an average U.S"
"household consumed in 24 days.In February 2021, U.S"
"Treasury secretary Janet Yellen called Bitcoin ""an extremely inefficient way to conduct transactions"", saying ""the amount of energy consumed in processing those transactions is staggering"""
"In March 2021, Bill Gates stated that ""Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind"", adding ""It's not a great climate thing.""Nicholas Weaver, of the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, examined blockchain's online security, and the energy efficiency of proof-of-work public blockchains, and in both cases found it grossly inadequate"
The 31TWh-45TWh of electricity used for bitcoin in 2018 produced 17-23 million tonnes of CO2
"By 2022, the University of Cambridge and Digiconomist estimated that the two largest proof-of-work blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, together used twice as much electricity in one year as the whole of Sweden, leading to the release of up to 120 million tonnes of CO2 each year.Some cryptocurrency developers are considering moving from the proof-of-work model to the proof-of-stake model.


== Academic research ==

In October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology access to $100 of bitcoin"
"The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology"
"Many universities have founded departments focusing on crypto and blockchain, including MIT, in 2017"
"In the same year, Edinburgh became ""one of the first big European universities to launch a blockchain course"", according to the Financial Times.


=== Adoption decision ===
Motivations for adopting blockchain technology (an aspect of innovation adoptation) have been investigated by researchers"
"For example, Janssen, et al"
"provided a framework for analysis, and Koens & Poll pointed out that adoption could be heavily driven by non-technical factors"
"Based on behavioral models, Li has discussed the differences between adoption at the individual level and organizational levels.


=== Collaboration ===
Scholars in business and management have started studying the role of blockchains to support collaboration"
"It has been argued that blockchains can foster both cooperation (i.e., prevention of opportunistic behavior) and coordination (i.e., communication and information sharing)"
"Thanks to reliability, transparency, traceability of records, and information immutability, blockchains facilitate collaboration in a way that differs both from the traditional use of contracts and from relational norms"
"Contrary to contracts, blockchains do not directly rely on the legal system to enforce agreements"
"In addition, contrary to the use of relational norms, blockchains do not require a trust or direct connections between collaborators.


=== Blockchain and internal audit ===
The need for internal audits to provide effective oversight of organizational efficiency will require a change in the way that  information  is accessed in new formats"
Blockchain adoption requires a framework to identify the risk of exposure associated with transactions using blockchain
The Institute of Internal Auditors has identified the need for internal auditors to address this transformational technology
 New methods are required to develop audit plans that identify threats and risks
"The Internal Audit Foundation study, Blockchain and Internal Audit, assesses these factors"
"The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has outlined new roles for auditors as a result of blockchain.


=== Journals ===

In September 2015, the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology research, Ledger, was announced"
The inaugural issue was published in December 2016
"The journal covers aspects of mathematics, computer science, engineering, law, economics and philosophy that relate to cryptocurrencies"
"The journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which are then timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain"
"Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address on the first page of their papers for non-repudiation purposes.

"In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system"
Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate
"The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels"
"Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane"
Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight
"Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.
Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common"
"Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss"
"Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes"
"Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct"
"Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries"
"These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss"
Human migration and conflict can also be a result
The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century
Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks in the future without action to limit warming
"Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops reduces climate change risks, although this may not be possible with increasing warming"
"Poorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet they have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.
Many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) level of warming"
"Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet"
"Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming ""well under 2 °C"""
"However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century"
"Limiting warming to 1.5 °C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Reducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels"
"This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use"
"Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities"
"Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and by farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.


== Terminology ==
Before the 1980s, when it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases were stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution, scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate.In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common"
"Though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably, scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes the totality of changes to Earth's climate system"
Global warming—used as early as 1975—became the more popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S
Senate
"Since the 2000s, climate change has increased in usage"
"Climate change can also refer more broadly to both human-caused changes or natural changes throughout Earth's history.Various scientists, politicians and media now use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming.


== Observed temperature rise ==

Multiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming"
The 2011–2020 decade warmed to an average 1.09 °C [0.95–1.20 °C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900)
"Surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2 °C per decade, with 2020 reaching a temperature of 1.2 °C above the pre-industrial era"
"Since 1950, the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased.There was little net warming between the 18th century and the mid-19th century"
"Climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores"
Thermometer records began to provide global coverage around 1850
"Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions"
Temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late-20th century in a limited set of regions
"There have been prehistorical episodes of global warming, such as the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum"
"However, the modern observed rise in temperature and CO2 concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in Earth's history do not approach current rates.Evidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other observations"
"For example, changes to the natural water cycle have been predicted and observed, such as an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity"
"Flora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring"
"Another key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's surface and preventing it from radiating into space.Regions of the world warm at differing rates"
"The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet"
"Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature"
"This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation"
"The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean"
"The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.The Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere"
"The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice"
"As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat"
Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming
Arctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world
"Melting of glaciers and ice sheets in the Arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened Gulf Stream, further changing the climate.


== Attribution of recent temperature rise ==

The climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)), decades or even centuries"
"Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is ""external"" to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth"
"Examples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.To determine the human contribution to climate change, known internal climate variability and natural external forcings need to be ruled out"
"A key approach is to determine unique ""fingerprints"" for all potential causes, then compare these fingerprints with observed patterns of climate change"
"For example, solar forcing can be ruled out as a major cause"
Its fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere
"Yet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing"
"Attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect.


=== Greenhouse gases ===

Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface"
"The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it"
"This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time"
"Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 °C warmer than it would have been in their absence"
"While water vapour (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks"
"On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as CO2 (~20%), tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore external forcings.Human activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative imbalance"
"In 2019, the concentrations of CO2 and methane had increased by about 48% and 160%, respectively, since 1750"
These CO2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years
"Concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years.

Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of CO2"
"Of these emissions, 75% was CO2, 18% was methane, 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% was fluorinated gases"
"CO2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity"
"Additional CO2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the CO2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser"
"Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction"
"Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser.Despite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the Earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for CO2"
"Land-surface sink processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, remove about 29% of annual global CO2 emissions"
The ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process
"First, CO2 dissolves in the surface water"
"Afterwards, the ocean's overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle"
"Over the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted CO2.


=== Aerosols and clouds ===
Air pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale"
Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation
"From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed"
"This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, and is attributed to aerosols produced by dust, pollution and combustion of biofuels and fossil fuels"
"Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.Aerosols also have indirect effects on the Earth's radiation budget"
Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets
These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets
"They also reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight"
"Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming"
"Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise"
"Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2 °C by 2050.


=== Land surface changes ===

Humans change the Earth's surface mainly to create more agricultural land"
"Today, agriculture takes up 34% of Earth's land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.)"
"The amount of forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming"
"Deforestation releases CO2 contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more CO2 in the future"
"The main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce forestry/forest products (26%), short term shifting cultivation (24%), and wildfires (23%).The type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature"
"It impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation"
"For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight"
"Deforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns"
"In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to a cooling effect"
"Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo"
"According to FAO, forest degradation aggravates the impacts of climate change as it reduces the carbon sequestration abilities of forests"
"Indeed, among their many benefits, forests also have the potential to reduce the impact of high temperatures.


=== Solar and volcanic activity ===

As the Sun is the Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system"
"Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards"
There has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth.Explosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era
"When the eruption is sufficiently strong (with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere), sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years"
The temperature signal lasts about twice as long
"In the industrial era, volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends"
Present-day volcanic CO2 emissions are equivalent to less than 1% of current anthropogenic CO2 emissions.Physical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity
"Further evidence for greenhouse gases causing global warming comes from measurements that show a warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), coupled with a cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere)"
"If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, the troposphere and stratosphere would both warm.


=== Climate change feedback ===

The response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by ""self-reinforcing"" or ""positive"" feedbacks and reduced by ""balancing"" or ""negative"" feedbacks"
"The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds"
"The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as Earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature"
"In addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of CO2 on plant growth"
"Uncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.As air warms, it can hold more moisture"
"Water vapour, as a potent greenhouse gas, holds heat in the atmosphere"
"If cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet"
"If clouds become higher and thinner, they act as an insulator, reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet"
"The effect of clouds is the largest source of feedback uncertainty.Another major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic, which reduces the reflectivity of the Earth's surface.
More of the Sun's energy is now absorbed in these regions, contributing to amplification of Arctic temperature changes"
"Arctic amplification is also melting permafrost, which releases methane and CO2 into the atmosphere"
"Climate change can also cause methane releases from wetlands, marine systems, and freshwater systems"
"Overall, climate feedbacks are expected to become increasingly positive.Around half of human-caused CO2 emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans"
"On land, elevated CO2 and an extended growing season have stimulated plant growth"
"Climate change increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth, which makes it uncertain whether this carbon sink will continue to grow in the future"
Soils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up
"As more CO2 and heat are absorbed by the ocean, it acidifies, its circulation changes and phytoplankton takes up less carbon, decreasing the rate at which the ocean absorbs atmospheric carbon"
"Overall, at higher CO2 concentrations the Earth will absorb a reduced fraction of our emissions.


== Modelling ==

A climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system"
" Models also include natural processes like changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the Sun's activity, and volcanic forcing"
"Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks, or reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates"
Past models have underestimated the rate of Arctic shrinkage and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase
"Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but more recent models agree well with observations"
"The 2017 United States-published National Climate Assessment notes that ""climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes"".A subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate model"
"These models simulate how population, economic growth, and energy use affect – and interact with – the physical climate"
"With this information, these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions"
This is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future
"Depending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario, models produce atmospheric CO2 concentrations that range widely between 380 and 1400 ppm.The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report projects that global warming is very likely to reach 1.0 °C to 1.8 °C by the late 21st century under the very low GHG emissions scenario"
"In an intermediate scenario global warming would reach 2.1 °C to 3.5 °C, and 3.3 °C to 5.7 °C under the very high GHG emissions scenario"
These projections are based on climate models in combination with observations.The remaining carbon budget is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases
"According to the IPCC, global warming can be kept below 1.5 °C with a two-thirds chance if emissions after 2018 do not exceed 420 or 570 gigatonnes of CO2"
This corresponds to 10 to 13 years of current emissions
There are high uncertainties about the budget
"For instance, it may be 100 gigatonnes of CO2 smaller due to methane release from permafrost and wetlands"
"However, it is clear that fossil fuel resources are too abundant for shortages to be relied on to limit carbon emissions in the 21st century.


== Impacts ==


=== Environmental effects ===

The environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather"
Changes may occur gradually or rapidly
"Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations"
"Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency"
Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia
"The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing, and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming"
"Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change.

Global sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt, melt of the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, and thermal expansion"
"Between 1993 and 2020, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.3 ± 0.3 mm per year"
"Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by 61–110 cm"
"Increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug Antarctic glacier outlets, risking a large melt of the ice sheet and the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions.Climate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice"
"While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °C degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2 °C"
Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to changes in ocean chemistry
An increase in dissolved CO2 is causing oceans to acidify
"In addition, oxygen levels are decreasing as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water"
"Dead zones in the ocean, regions with very little oxygen, are expanding too.


=== Tipping points and long-term impacts ===
Greater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through ‘tipping points’—thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are reduced"
"An example is the collapse of West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, where a temperature rise of 1.5 to 2 °C may commit the ice sheets to melt, although the time scale of melt is uncertain and depends on future warming"
"Some large-scale changes could occur over a short time period, such as a shutdown of certain ocean currents like the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)"
"Tipping points can also include irreversible damage to ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs.The long-term effects of climate change on oceans include further ice melt, ocean warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification"
"On the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of climate change will be determined primarily by anthropogenic CO2 emissions"
This is due to CO2's long atmospheric lifetime
Oceanic CO2 uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will continue for hundreds to thousands of years
"These emissions are estimated to have prolonged the current interglacial period by at least 100,000 years"
"Sea level rise will continue over many centuries, with an estimated rise of 2.3 metres per degree Celsius (4.2 ft/°F) after 2000 years.


=== Nature and wildlife ===

Recent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes"
Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening
"However, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions"
The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear
"Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics"
The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely
"Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species.The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land"
"Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, harming a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds"
"Ocean acidification makes it harder for marine calcifying organisms such as mussels, barnacles and corals to produce shells and skeletons; and heatwaves have bleached coral reefs"
"Harmful algal blooms enhanced by climate change and eutrophication lower oxygen levels, disrupt food webs and cause great loss of marine life"
Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress
"Almost half of global wetlands have disappeared due to climate change and other human impacts.


=== Humans ===

The effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world"
"Impacts can now be observed on all continents and ocean regions, with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk"
"Continued warming has potentially “severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts” for people and ecosystems"
"The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries.


==== Food and health ====
The WHO has classified climate change as the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century"
"Extreme weather leads to injury and loss of life, and crop failures to undernutrition"
"Various infectious diseases are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate, such as dengue fever and malaria"
Young children are the most vulnerable to food shortages
Both children and older people are vulnerable to extreme heat
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that between 2030 and 2050, climate change would cause around 250,000 additional deaths per year"
"They assessed deaths from heat exposure in elderly people, increases in diarrhea, malaria, dengue, coastal flooding, and childhood undernutrition"
"Over 500,000 more adult deaths are projected yearly by 2050 due to reductions in food availability and quality"
"By 2100, 50% to 75% of the global population may face climate conditions that are life-threatening due to combined effects of extreme heat and humidity.Climate change is affecting food security"
"It has caused reduction in global yields of maize, wheat, and soybeans between 1981 and 2010"
Future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops
"Crop production will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative"
"Up to an additional 183 million people worldwide, particularly those with lower incomes, are at risk of hunger as a consequence of these impacts"
Climate change also impacts fish populations
"Globally, less will be available to be fished"
"Regions dependent on glacier water, regions that are already dry, and small islands have a higher risk of water stress due to climate change.


==== Livelihoods ====
Economic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences"
"Climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and this trend is projected to continue"
"Most of the severe impacts are expected in sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources and South-East Asia"
The World Bank estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030.Current inequalities based on wealth and social status have worsened due to climate change
"Major difficulties in mitigating, adapting, and recovering to climate shocks are faced by marginalized people who have less control over resources"
"Indigenous people, who are subsistent on their land and ecosystems, will face endangerment to their wellness and lifestyles due to climate change"
"An expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities.Low-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes flooding more common"
"Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea"
"This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu"
"In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to"
"With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in extremely hot and uninhabitable climates, similar to the current climate found in the Sahara"
"These factors can drive environmental migration, both within and between countries"
"More people are expected to be displaced because of sea level rise, extreme weather and conflict from increased competition over natural resources"
"Climate change may also increase vulnerability, leading to ""trapped populations"" who are not able to move due to a lack of resources.


== Reducing and recapturing emissions ==

Climate change can be mitigated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing sinks that absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere"
"In order to limit global warming to less than 1.5 °C global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2 °C target"
"This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry"
The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the Paris Agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to 2 °C
An even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 1.5 °C goal
"With pledges made under the Agreement as of October 2021, global warming would still have a 66% chance of reaching about 2.7 °C (range: 2.2–3.2 °C) by the end of the century"
"Globally, limiting warming to 2 °C may result in higher benefits than costs.Although there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 °C, most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions"
"To reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities, changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry, such as preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation.Other approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk"
Scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5 °C typically project the large-scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the 21st century
"There are concerns, though, about over-reliance on these technologies, and environmental impacts"
Solar radiation modification (SRM) is also a possible supplement to deep reductions in emissions
"However, SRM would raise significant ethical and legal issues, and the risks are poorly understood.


=== Clean energy ===

Renewable energy is key to limiting climate change"
Fossil fuels accounted for 80% of the world's energy in 2018
"The remaining share was split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power and geothermal energy)"
That mix is projected to change significantly over the next 30 years
Solar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations
"Renewables represented 75% of all new electricity generation installed in 2019, nearly all solar and wind"
"Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply"
"However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison.To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios"
Investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050.Electricity generated from renewable sources would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport
"Transport can switch away from internal combustion engine vehicles and towards electric vehicles, public transit, and active transport (cycling and walking)"
"For shipping and flying, low-carbon fuels would reduce emissions"
"Heating could be increasingly decarbonised with technologies like heat pumps.There are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy, including renewables"
"For wind and solar, there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects"
Wind and solar also produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability
"Traditionally, hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power plants have been used when variable energy production is low"
"Going forward, battery storage can be expanded, energy demand and supply can be matched, and long-distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs"
Bioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security
"The growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around nuclear waste, nuclear weapon proliferation, and accidents"
"Hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed, and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns.Low-carbon energy improves human health by minimising climate change"
"It also has the near-term benefit of reducing air pollution deaths, which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016"
"Meeting the Paris Agreement goals that limit warming to a 2 °C increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050, whereas limiting global warming to 1.5 °C could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security and reduce poverty"
"Improving air quality also has economic benefits which may be larger than mitigation costs.


=== Energy conservation ===

Reducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions"
"If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development"
"It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimises carbon-intensive infrastructure development"
"Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy"
"Several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain.Strategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector"
"In transport, passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, or use electric vehicles"
"Industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and increasing product lifetimes"
"In the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting"
"The use of technologies like heat pumps can also increase building energy efficiency.


=== Agriculture and industry ===

 Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand"
A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two thirds from 2010 levels
"These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production.On the demand side, a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards plant-based diets"
Eliminating the production of livestock for meat and dairy would eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use
"Livestock also occupy 37% of ice-free land area on Earth and consume feed from the 12% of land area used for crops, driving deforestation and land degradation.Steel and cement production are responsible for about 13% of industrial CO2 emissions"
"In these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production, so that reducing CO2 emissions requires research into alternative chemistries.


=== Carbon sequestration ===

Natural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels"
"Reforestation and tree planting on non-forest lands are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns"
"Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments"
"In one of its recent publications, FAO maintains that forest and landscape restoration yields many benefits for the climate, including greenhouse gas emissions sequestration and reduction"
Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter (blue carbon)
"When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems.Where energy production or CO2-intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste CO2, the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere"
"Although its current use is limited in scale and expensive, carbon capture and storage (CCS) may be able to play a significant role in limiting CO2 emissions by mid-century"
"This technique, in combination with bioenergy (BECCS) can result in net negative emissions: CO2 is drawn from the atmosphere"
It remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1.5 °C
"Policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals.


== Adaptation ==

Adaptation is ""the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects"".: 5  Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of ""severe, widespread and irreversible"" impacts"
"More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive"
"The capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less"
"The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow"
Many countries have implemented adaptation policies
"However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance.Adaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas, learning to live with increased flooding and protection"
"If that fails, managed retreat may be needed"
There are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact
Avoiding strenuous work or having air conditioning is not possible for everybody
"In agriculture, adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets, diversification, erosion control and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate"
"Insurance allows for risk-sharing, but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes"
"Education, migration and early warning systems can reduce climate vulnerability"
"Planting mangroves or encouraging other coastal vegetation can buffer storms.Ecosystems adapt to climate change, a process that can be supported by human intervention"
"By increasing connectivity between ecosystems, species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions"
Species can also be introduced to areas acquiring a favorable climate
"Protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt"
"Many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt via ecosystem-based adaptation"
"For instance, restoration of natural fire regimes makes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces human exposure"
"Giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system, reducing flood risk"
"Restored forest acts as a carbon sink, but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts.There are synergies but also trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation"
"Adaptation often offer short-term benefits, whereas mitigation has longer-term benefits"
"Two examples for trade-offs include: Increased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat, but increases energy demand"
Compact urban development may lead to reduced emissions from transport and construction
"At the same time, this kind of urban development may increase the urban heat island effect, leading to higher temperatures and increased exposure"
"An example for synergy is increased food productivity which has large benefits for both adaptation and mitigation.


== Policies and politics ==

Countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions"
This raises questions about justice and fairness
Climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development
"Limiting global warming makes it easier to achieve sustainable development goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities"
"The connection is recognised in Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to ""take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"""
"The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation.The geopolitics of climate change is complex"
"It has often been framed as a free-rider problem, in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves"
This framing has been challenged
"For instance, the benefits of a coal phase-out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions"
"Furthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to face stranded assets: fossil fuels they cannot sell.


=== Policy options ===
A wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions"
"As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions"
Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems
"Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in"
Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths
Money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead
"More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry"
Several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production.Policy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality
"For instance, wealthy nations responsible for the largest share of emissions would have to pay poorer countries to adapt"
"As the use of fossil fuels is reduced, jobs in the sector are being lost"
"To achieve a just transition, these people would need to be retrained for other jobs"
"Communities with many fossil fuel workers would need additional investments.


=== International climate agreements ===

Nearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)"
The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system
"As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained"
The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do
Global emissions have risen since the UNFCCC was signed
Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations.The 1997 Kyoto Protocol extended the UNFCCC and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions
"During the negotiations, the G77 (representing developing countries) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to ""[take] the lead"" in reducing their emissions, since developed countries contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere"
"Per-capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs.The 2009 Copenhagen Accord has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, and was rejected by poorer nations including the G77"
Associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 °C
"The Accord set the goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and proposed the founding of the Green Climate Fund"
"As of 2020, the fund has failed to reach its expected target, and risks a shrinkage in its funding.In 2015 all UN countries negotiated the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below 2.0 °C and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under 1.5 °C"
The agreement replaced the Kyoto Protocol
"Unlike Kyoto, no binding emission targets were set in the Paris Agreement"
"Instead, a set of procedures was made binding"
Countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years
The Paris Agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported
"As of October 2021, 194 states and the European Union have signed the treaty and 191 states and the EU have ratified or acceded to the agreement.The 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to stop emitting ozone-depleting gases, may have been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the Kyoto Protocol specifically designed to do so"
"The 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol aims to reduce the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a group of powerful greenhouse gases which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases"
"This made the Montreal Protocol a stronger agreement against climate change.


=== National responses ===
In 2019, the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency"
Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit
"That same year, the European Parliament declared a ""climate and environmental emergency"""
The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050
"Major countries in Asia have made similar pledges: South Korea and Japan have committed to become carbon-neutral by 2050, and China by 2060"
"In 2021, the European Commission released its “Fit for 55” legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035"
"While India has strong incentives for renewables, it also plans a significant expansion of coal in the country"
"Vietnam is among very few coal-dependent fast developing countries that pledged to phase out unabated coal power by the 2040s or as soon as possible there after.As of 2021, based on information from 48 national climate plans, which represent 40% of the parties to the Paris Agreement, estimated total greenhouse gas emissions will be 0.5% lower compared to 2010 levels, below the 45% or 25% reduction goals to limit global warming to 1.5 °C or 2 °C, respectively.


== Society ==


=== Denial and misinformation ===

Public debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia"
"The actors behind climate change denial form a well-funded and relatively coordinated coalition of fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists"
"Like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about scientific data and results"
"Many who deny, dismiss, or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change are labelled as ""climate change skeptics"", which several scientists have noted is a misnomer.There are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimise the negative impacts of climate change"
Manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufactured controversy: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes
"Strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions, and questioning the motives of individual scientists"
"An echo chamber of climate-denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change.


=== Public awareness and opinion ===

Climate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s"
"Due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion"
"In popular culture, the climate fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006) focused on climate change.Significant regional, gender, age and political differences exist in both public concern for, and understanding of, climate change"
"More highly educated people, and in some countries, women and younger people, were more likely to see climate change as a serious threat"
"Partisan gaps also exist in many countries, and countries with high CO2 emissions tend to be less concerned"
Views on causes of climate change vary widely between countries
"Concern has increased over time, to the point where in 2021 a majority of citizens in many countries express a high level of worry about climate change, or view it as a global emergency"
"Higher levels of worry are associated with stronger public support for policies that address climate change.


==== Climate movement ====

Climate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change"
"They can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities"
Prominent demonstrations include the School Strike for Climate
"In this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg"
Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport
Litigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies
Activists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change
"Lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies generally seek compensation for loss and damage.


== History ==


=== Early discoveries ===

Scientists in the 19th century such as Alexander von Humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change"
"In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the sun's energy alone could explain"
"Earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat"
"However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet.In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and that the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide (CO2)"
"She concluded that ""An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature...""Starting in 1859, John Tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen—together totaling 99% of dry air—are transparent to radiated heat"
"However, water vapour and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat into the atmosphere"
"Tyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past, including ice ages.Svante Arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but the CO2 concentration in air was influenced by long-term geological processes"
"Warming from increased CO2 levels would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying warming in a positive feedback loop"
"In 1896, he published the first climate model of its kind, projecting that halving CO2 levels could have produced a drop in temperature initiating an ice age"
Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling CO2 to be around 5–6 °C
"Other scientists were initially skeptical and believed that the greenhouse effect was saturated so that adding more CO2 would make no difference, and that the climate would be self-regulating"
"Beginning in 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar published evidence that climate was warming and CO2 levels were rising, but his calculations met the same objections.


=== Development of a scientific consensus ===

In the 1950s, Gilbert Plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum"
This model predicted that increasing CO2 levels would cause warming
"Around the same time, Hans Suess found evidence that CO2 levels had been rising, and Roger Revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase"
"The two scientists subsequently helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the ""Keeling Curve"""
"Scientists alerted the public, and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansen's 1988 Congressional testimony"
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred interdisciplinary research"
"As part of the IPCC reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles.There is a near-complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities"
"As of 2019, agreement in recent literature reached over 99%"
No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view
Consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change
National science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions
"The 2021 IPCC Assessment Report stated that it is ""unequivocal"" that climate change is caused by humans.

Renewable energy is energy from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale
"Renewable resources include sunlight, wind, the movement of water, and geothermal heat"
"Although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not"
"For example, some biomass sources are considered unsustainable at current rates of exploitation"
"Renewable energy is often used for electricity generation, heating and cooling"
"Renewable energy projects are typically large-scale, but they are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries, where energy is often crucial in human development"
"Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification, which has several benefits: electricity can move heat or objects efficiently, and is clean at the point of consumption"
"In addition, electrification with renewable energy is more efficient and therefore leads to significant reductions in primary energy requirements.From 2011 to 2021, renewable energy has grown from 20% to 28% of global electricity supply"
"Use of fossil energy shrank from 68% to 62%, and nuclear from 12% to 10%"
The share of hydropower decreased from 16% to 15% while power from sun and wind increased from 2% to 10%
Biomass and geothermal energy grew from 2% to 3%
"There are 3,146 gigawatts installed in 135 countries, while 156 countries have laws regulating the renewable energy sector"
"  In 2021, China accounted for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity.Globally there are over 10 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer"
"Renewable energy systems are rapidly becoming more efficient and cheaper and their share of total energy consumption is increasing, with a large majority of worldwide newly installed electricity capacity being renewable"
"In most countries, photovoltaic solar or onshore wind are the cheapest new-build electricity.Many nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of their total energy supply, with some generating over half their electricity from renewables"
A few countries generate all their electricity using renewable energy
National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the 2020s and beyond
"According to the IEA, to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, 90% of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources"
"Some studies have shown that a global transition to 100% renewable energy across all sectors – power, heat, transport and desalination – is feasible and economically viable"
"Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to fossil fuels, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries"
"Deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits"
However renewables are being hindered by hundreds of billions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies
In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for renewables such as solar power and wind power
"In 2022 the International Energy Agency asked countries to solve policy, regulatory, permitting and financing obstacles to adding more renewables, to have a better chance of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.


== Overview ==


=== Definition ===

Renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as sunlight, wind, tides, plant growth, and geothermal heat, as the International Energy Agency explains:
Renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly"
"In its various forms, it derives directly from the sun, or from heat generated deep within the earth"
"Included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, biomass, geothermal resources, and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources.


=== Drivers and benefits ===
Renewable energy stands in contrast to fossil fuels, which are being used far more quickly than they are being replenished"
"Renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries"
"Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, and technological diversification of energy sources, would result in significant energy security and economic benefits"
Solar and wind power have got much cheaper
"In some cases it will be cheaper to transition to these sources as opposed to continuing to use the current, inefficient, fossil fuels"
"It would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels, and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that could amount to trillions of dollars annually"
"Multiple analyses of decarbonization strategies have found that quantified health benefits can significantly offset the costs of implementing these strategies.Climate change concerns, coupled with the continuing fall in the costs of some renewable energy equipment, such as wind turbines and solar panels, are driving increased use of renewables"
"New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the global financial crisis better than many other sectors"
"As of 2019, however, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, renewables overall share in the energy mix (including power, heat and transport) needs to grow six times faster, in order to keep the rise in average global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0 °C (3.6 °F) during the present century, compared to pre-industrial levels.


=== Scale ===

A household's solar panels, and batteries if they have them, can often either be used for just that household or if connected to an electrical grid can be aggregated with millions of others"
"Over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking, and more than 166 million households rely on a new generation of more-efficient biomass cookstoves"
"According to the research, a nation must reach a certain point in its growth before it can take use of more renewable energy"
"In our words, its addition changed how crucial input factors (labor and capital) connect to one another, lowering their overall elasticity and increasing the apparent economies of scale"
United Nations' eighth Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity
"At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply"
"Although many countries have various policy targets for longer-term shares of renewable energy these tend to be only for the power sector, including a 40% target of all electricity generated for the European Union by 2030.


=== Uses ===
Renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services.


==== Power generation ====
More than a quarter of electricity is generated from renewables as of 2021.


==== Heating and cooling ====
Solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180  GWth)"
Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China
"Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households"
"In Sweden, national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil"
"Heat pumps provide both heating and cooling, and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing priority Renewable thermal energy is also growing rapidly"
"About 10% of heating and cooling energy is from renewables.


==== Transportation ====

One of the efforts to decarbonize transportation is the increased use of electric vehicles (EVs)"
"Despite that and the use of biofuels, such as biojet, less than 4% of transport energy is from renewables"
"Occasionally hydrogen fuel cells are used for heavy transport.


== Mainstream technologies ==


=== Solar energy ===

Solar energy, radiant light and heat from the sun, is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, concentrated solar power (CSP), concentrator photovoltaics (CPV), solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis"
Most new renewable energy is solar
"Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert, and distribute solar energy"
"Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air"
"Active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy, using solar collectors for heating, and solar power, converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).
A photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current (DC) by taking advantage of the photoelectric effect"
"Solar PV has turned into a multi-billion, fast-growing industry, continues to improve its cost-effectiveness, and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with CSP"
Concentrated solar power (CSP) systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam
Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s
"CSP-Stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies.
In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that ""the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits"
"It will increase countries' energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise"
These advantages are global
"Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared"""
"Solar power accounts for 505 GW annually, which is about 2% of the world's electricity"
"Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight; however, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions, geographic location and time of day"
"According to chapter 6 of the IPCC 2022 climate mitigation report, the global potential of direct solar energy far exceeds that of any other renewable energy resource"
It is well beyond the total amount of energy needed in order to support mitigation over the current century
" Australia has the largest proportion of solar electricity in the world, supplying 9.9% of the country's electrical demand in 2020"
"More than 30 per cent of Australian households now have rooftop solar PV, with a combined capacity exceeding 11 GW.


=== Wind power ===

Air flow can be used to run wind turbines"
Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power
"The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine"
"Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms"
"Typically, full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed"
"Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China"
"In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%.Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome"
"This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore, and likely also industrial use of new types of VAWT turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use"
"As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines.


=== Hydropower ===

Since water is about 800 times denser than air, even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea swell, can yield considerable amounts of energy"
"Water can generate electricity with a conversion efficiency of about 90%, which is the highest rate in renewable energy"
"There are many forms of water energy:

Historically, hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs, which are still popular in developing countries"
"The largest of them are the Three Gorges Dam (2003) in China and the Itaipu Dam (1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay.
Small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 50 MW of power"
They are often used on small rivers or as a low-impact development on larger rivers
"China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations.
Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir"
"The water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley (using channels, pipes and/or tunnels) until it is high above the valley floor, whereupon it can be allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine"
"A run-of-river plant may still produce a large amount of electricity, such as the Chief Joseph Dam on the Columbia River in the United States"
"However many run-of-the-river hydro power plants are micro hydro or pico hydro plants.Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010"
"Of the top 50 countries by percentage of electricity generated from renewables, 46 are primarily hydroelectric"
"There are now seven hydroelectricity stations larger than 10 GW (10,000 MW) worldwide, see table below.

Much hydropower is flexible, thus complementing wind and solar"
"Wave power, which captures the energy of ocean surface waves, and tidal power, converting the energy of tides, are two forms of hydropower with future potential; however, they are not yet widely employed commercially"
" A demonstration project operated by the Ocean Renewable Power Company on the coast of Maine, and connected to the grid, harnesses tidal power from the Bay of Fundy, location of the world's highest tidal flow"
"Ocean thermal energy conversion, which uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters, currently has no economic feasibility.


=== Bioenergy ===

Biomass is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms"
It commonly refers to plants or plant-derived materials
"As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel in solid, liquid or gaseous form"
"Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into: thermal, chemical, and biochemical methods"
"Wood was the largest biomass energy source as of 2012; examples include forest residues – such as dead trees, branches and tree stumps, yard clippings, wood chips and even municipal solid waste"
"Industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants, including miscanthus, switchgrass, hemp, corn, poplar, willow, sorghum, sugarcane, bamboo, and a variety of tree species, ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm (palm oil).
Plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy"
The grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity
"Plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments, and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel.
Biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy such as methane gas or transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel"
"Rotting garbage, and agricultural and human waste, all release methane gas – also called landfill gas or biogas"
"Crops, such as corn and sugarcane, can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel, ethanol"
"Biodiesel, another transportation fuel, can be produced from left-over food products such as vegetable oils and animal fats"
"There is a great deal of research involving algal fuel or algae-derived biomass due to the fact that it is a non-food resource, grows around 20 times faster than other types of food crops, such as corn and soy, and can be grown almost anywhere"
"Once harvested, it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol, butanol, and methane, as well as biodiesel and hydrogen"
The biomass used for electricity generation varies by region
"Forest by-products, such as wood residues, are common in the United States"
Agricultural waste is common in Mauritius (sugar cane residue) and Southeast Asia (rice husks)
"
Biofuels include a wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass"
"The term covers solid, liquid, and gaseous fuels"
"Liquid biofuels include bioalcohols, such as bioethanol, and oils, such as biodiesel"
"Gaseous biofuels include biogas, landfill gas and synthetic gas"
Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops
"These include maize, sugarcane and, more recently, sweet sorghum"
"The latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions, and is being investigated by International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics for its potential to provide fuel, along with food and animal feed, in arid parts of Asia and Africa.With advanced technology being developed, cellulosic biomass, such as trees and grasses, are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production"
"Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions"
Bioethanol is widely used in the United States and in Brazil
"The energy costs for producing bio-ethanol are almost equal to, the energy yields from bio-ethanol"
"However, according to the European Environment Agency, biofuels do not address global warming concerns"
"Biodiesel is made from vegetable oils, animal fats or recycled greases"
"It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, or more commonly as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles"
Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Europe
"Biofuels provided 2.7% of the world's transport fuel in 2010.Biomass, biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat/power and in doing so can harm the environment"
"Pollutants such as sulphurous oxides (SOx), nitrous oxides (NOx), and particulate matter (PM) are produced from the combustion of biomass"
"With regards to traditional use of biomass for heating and cooking, the World Health Organization estimates that 3.7 million prematurely died from outdoor air pollution in 2012 while indoor pollution from biomass burning effects over 3 billion people worldwide.


=== Geothermal energy ===

High temperature geothermal energy is from thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth"
Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter
Earth's geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of minerals (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions)
"The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface"
"The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots geo, meaning earth, and thermos, meaning heat.
The heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the Earth, all the way down to Earth's core – 6,400 kilometres (4,000 mi) down"
"At the core, temperatures may reach over 5,000 °C (9,030 °F)"
Heat conducts from the core to the surrounding rock
"Extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt, which is commonly known as magma"
Magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock
"This magma then heats rock and water in the crust, sometimes up to 371 °C (700 °F).Low temperature geothermal refers to the use of the outer crust of the Earth as a thermal battery to facilitate renewable thermal energy for heating and cooling buildings, and other refrigeration and industrial uses"
"In this form of geothermal, a geothermal heat pump and ground-coupled heat exchanger are used together to move heat energy into the Earth (for cooling) and out of the Earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis"
"Low-temperature geothermal (generally referred to as ""GHP"") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements"
"Thus low temperature geothermal/GHP is becoming an increasing national priority with multiple tax credit support and focus as part of the ongoing movement toward net zero energy.


=== Solar thermal ===


== Emerging technologies ==
There are also other renewable energy technologies that are still under development, including cellulosic ethanol, hot-dry-rock geothermal power, and marine energy"
These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization
"Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research, development and demonstration (RD&D) funding.There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large-scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy"
This research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum
"Most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields.
Multiple government supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years"
"Two of the most prominent of these labs are Sandia National Laboratories and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), both of which are funded by the United States Department of Energy and supported by various corporate partners.


=== Enhanced geothermal system ===

Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are a new type of geothermal power technology that does not require natural convective hydrothermal resources"
The vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non-porous rock
"EGS technologies ""enhance"" and/or create geothermal resources in this ""hot dry rock (HDR)"" through hydraulic fracturing"
"EGS and HDR technologies, such as hydrothermal geothermal, are expected to be baseload resources that produce power 24 hours a day like a fossil plant"
"Distinct from hydrothermal, HDR and EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world, depending on the economic limits of drill depth"
Good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick (3–5 km or 1.9–3.1 mi) layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss
"There are HDR and EGS systems currently being developed and tested in France, Australia, Japan, Germany, the U.S., and Switzerland"
"The largest EGS project in the world is a 25 megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the Cooper Basin, Australia"
"The Cooper Basin has the potential to generate 5,000–10,000 MW.


=== Marine energy ===

Marine energy (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy) is the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences"
"The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion"
"This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries"
"The term marine energy encompasses wave power – power from surface waves, marine current power - power from marine hydrokinetic streams (e.g., the Gulf Stream), and tidal power – obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water"
"Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh river water and salty sea water in large power cells designed for this purpose; as of 2016, it is being tested at a small scale (50 kW)"
"Offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the wind turbines are placed over water"
The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations
"Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world.


=== Passive daytime radiative cooling ===

Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) uses the coldness of outer space as a renewable energy source to achieve daytime cooling that can be used in many applications, such as indoor space cooling, outdoor urban heat island mitigation, and solar cell efficiency"
PDRC surfaces are designed to be high in solar reflectance to minimize heat gain and strong in longwave infrared (LWIR) thermal radiation heat transfer
"On a planetary scale, it has been proposed as a way to slow and reverse global warming"
"PDRC applications are deployed as sky-facing surfaces, similar to other renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic systems and solar thermal collectors"
"PDRC became possible with the ability to suppress solar heating using photonic metamaterials, first published in a study by Raman et al"
to the scientific community in 2014
"PDRC applications for indoor space cooling is growing with an estimated ""market size of ∼$27 billion in 2025.""


=== Artificial photosynthesis ===

Artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol"
"Researchers in this field strived to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that use a wider region of the solar spectrum, employ catalytic systems made from abundant, inexpensive materials that are robust, readily repaired, non-toxic, stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds, i.e., carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells)"
"However, prominent research faces hurdles, Sun Catalytix a MIT spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in 2012 because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight.


=== Earth infrared thermal radiation ===
Earth emits roughly 1017 W of infrared thermal radiation that flows toward the cold outer space"
Solar energy hits the surface and atmosphere of the earth and produces heat
"Using various theorized devices like emissive energy harvester (EEH) or thermoradiative diode, this energy flow can be converted into electricity"
"In theory, this technology can be used during nighttime.


=== Others ===


==== Algae fuels ====

Producing liquid fuels from oil-rich (fat-rich) varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic"
"Various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some systems that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands.


==== Water vapor ====
Collection of static electricity charges from water droplets on metal surfaces is an experimental technology that would be especially useful in low-income countries with relative air humidity over 60%.


==== Crop wastes ====
AuREUS devices (Aurora Renewable Energy & UV Sequestration), which are based on crop wastes can absorb ultraviolet light from the sun and turn it into renewable energy.


== Integration into the energy system and sector coupling ==

Renewable energy production from some sources such as wind and solar is more variable and more geographically spread than technology based on fossil fuels and nuclear"
"While integrating it into the wider energy system is feasible, it does lead to some additional challenges such as increased production volatility and decreased system inertia"
"Implementation of energy storage, using a wide variety of renewable energy technologies, and implementing a smart grid in which energy is automatically used at the moment it is produced can reduce risks and costs of renewable energy implementation.Sector coupling of the power generation sector with other sectors may increase flexibility: for example the transport sector can be coupled by charging electric vehicles and sending electricity from vehicle to grid"
"Similarly the industry sector can be coupled by hydrogen produced by electrolysis, and the buildings sector by thermal energy storage for space heating and cooling.


=== Electrical energy storage ===

Electrical energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy"
"Electrical energy is stored during times when production (especially from intermittent sources such as wind power, tidal power, solar power) exceeds consumption, and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption"
Pumped-storage hydroelectricity accounts for more than 85% of all grid power storage
Batteries are increasingly being deployed for storage and grid ancillary services and for domestic storage
"Green hydrogen is a more economical means of long-term renewable energy storage, in terms of capital expenditures compared to pumped hydroelectric or batteries.


== Market and industry trends ==

Most new renewables are solar, followed by wind then hydro then bioenergy.: 5  Investment in renewables, especially solar, tends to be more effective in creating jobs than coal, gas or oil"
"Worldwide, renewables employ about 12 million people as of 2020, with solar PV being the technology employing the most at almost 4 million.


=== Cost comparison ===
* = 2018"
"All other values for 2019.


=== Growth of renewables ===

The results of a recent review of the literature concluded that as greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from GHG emissions resulting in climate change, a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies.In the decade of 2010–2019, worldwide investment in renewable energy capacity excluding large hydropower amounted to US$2.7 trillion, of which the top countries China contributed US$818 billion, the United States contributed US$392.3 billion, Japan contributed US$210.9 billion, Germany contributed US$183.4 billion, and the United Kingdom contributed US$126.5 billion"
"This was an increase of over three and possibly four times the equivalent amount invested in the decade of 2000–2009 (no data is available for 2000–2003).


==== Future projections ====

A December 2022 report by the IEA forecasts that over 2022-2027, renewables are seen growing by almost 2 400 GW in its main forecast, equal to the entire installed power capacity of China in 2021"
"This is an 85% acceleration from the previous five years, and almost 30% higher than what the IEA forecast in its 2021 report, making its largest ever upward revision"
Renewables are set to account for over 90% of global electricity capacity expansion over the forecast period
"To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, IEA believes that 90% of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources.In June 2022 IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said that countries should invest more in renewables to ""ease the pressure on consumers from high fossil fuel prices, make our energy systems more secure, and get the world on track to reach our climate goals.”China's five year plan to 2025 includes increasing direct heating by renewables such as geothermal and solar thermal.REPowerEU, the EU plan to escape dependence on fossil Russian gas, is expected to call for much more green hydrogen.
After a transitional period, renewable energy production is expected to make up most of the world's energy production"
"In 2018, the risk management firm, DNV GL, forecasts that the world's primary energy mix will be split equally between fossil and non-fossil sources by 2050.


=== Demand ===
In July 2014, WWF and the World Resources Institute convened a discussion among a number of major US companies who had declared their intention to increase their use of renewable energy"
"These discussions identified a number of ""principles"" which companies seeking greater access to renewable energy considered important market deliverables"
"These principles included choice (between suppliers and between products), cost competitiveness, longer term fixed price supplies, access to third-party financing vehicles, and collaboration.UK statistics released in September 2020 noted that ""the proportion of demand met from renewables varies from a low of 3.4 per cent (for transport, mainly from biofuels) to highs of over 20 per cent for 'other final users', which is largely the service and commercial sectors that consume relatively large quantities of electricity, and industry"".In some locations, individual households can opt to purchase renewable energy through a consumer green energy program.


=== Trends for individual technologies ===


==== Hydroelectricity ====
In 2021, the world renewable hydropower capacity was 1 360 GW"
"Only a third of the world's estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed"
"New hydropower projects face opposition from local communities due to their large impact, including relocation of communities and flooding of wildlife habitats and farming land"
"High cost and lead times from permission process, including environmental and risk assessments, with lack of environmental and social acceptance are therefore the primary challenges for new developments"
It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid
"Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the Russell Dam built in 1985 may be updated with ""pump back"" facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power"
"Because dispatchable power is more valuable than VRE countries with large hydroelectric developments such as Canada and Norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro.


==== Wind power development ====

Offshore wind is becoming more profitable 


==== Photovoltaic development ====

Photovoltaics (PV) is rapidly-growing with global capacity increasing from 230 GW at the end of 2015 to 890 GW in 2021.PV uses solar cells assembled into solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity"
"PV systems range from small, residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations, to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station"
"The predominant PV technology is crystalline silicon, while thin-film solar cell technology accounts for about 10 percent of global photovoltaic deployment"
"In recent years, PV technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency, reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time, and reached grid parity.Building-integrated photovoltaics or ""onsite"" PV systems use existing land and structures and generate power close to where it is consumed.Photovoltaics grew fastest in China between 2016 and 2021 adding 560 GW, more than all advanced economies combined"
"Solar PV’s installed power capacity is poised to surpass that of coal by 2027, becoming the largest in the world"
"This requires an increase of installed PV capacity to 4,600 GW, of which more than half is expected to be deployed in China and India.

Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s"
"As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and gigawatt-scale solar power stations are being built"
"Many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built, mainly in Europe, China and the United States"
"The 1.5 GW Tengger Desert Solar Park, in China is the world's largest PV power station"
"Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed-mounted systems.


==== Biofuel development ====

Bioenergy global capacity in 2021 was 158 GW"
Biofuels avoided 4.4% of global transport fuel demand in 2021.Policies in more than 80 countries support biofuels demand
"Since the 1970s, Brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the world's second largest producer of ethanol (after the United States) and the world's largest exporter"
"Brazil's ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugarcane as feedstock, and the residual cane-waste (bagasse) is used to produce heat and power"
"There are no longer light vehicles in Brazil running on pure gasoline.Biojet is expected to be important for short-term reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from long-haul flights.


==== Geothermal development ====

Global geothermal capacity in 2021 was 15 GW.Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly, but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries"
"Recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation"
"Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are usually much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels"
"As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.
In 2017, the United States led the world in geothermal electricity production with 12.9 GW of installed capacity"
"The largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at The Geysers, a geothermal field in California"
"The Philippines follows the US as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world, with 1.9 GW of capacity online.


=== Developing countries ===


== Policy ==

Policies to support renewable energy have been vital in their expansion"
"Where Europe dominated in establishing energy policy in the early 2000s, most countries around the world now have some form of energy policy.


=== Policy trends ===
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide"
It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer
"IRENA was formed in 2009, with 75 countries signing the charter of IRENA"
"As of April 2019, IRENA has 160 member states"
"The then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy can lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity, and in September 2011 he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access,  efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy.The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies"
"In 2017, a total of 121 countries adopted some form of renewable energy policy"
National targets that year existed in 176 countries
"In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at the state/provincial, and local levels"
"Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades.
Many national, state and local governments have created green banks"
A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies
"Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy.
Climate neutrality by the year 2050 is the main goal of the European Green Deal"
"For the European Union to reach their target of climate neutrality, one goal is to decarbonise its energy system by aiming to achieve ""net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.""


=== Full renewable energy ===


== Debates ==

Renewable electricity generation by wind and solar is variable"
"This results in reduced capacity factor and may require keeping some gas-fired power plants or other dispatchable generation on standby until there is enough energy storage, demand response, grid improvement, and/or base load power from non-intermittent sources like hydropower, nuclear power or bioenergy.
The market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow"
"Climate change concerns and increasing in green jobs, coupled with high oil prices, peak oil, oil wars, oil spills, promotion of electric vehicles and renewable electricity, nuclear disasters and increasing government support, are driving increasing renewable energy legislation, incentives and commercialization.The International Energy Agency has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks.


=== Public support ===
Solar power plants may compete with arable land, while on-shore wind farms face opposition due to aesthetic concerns and noise, which is impacting both humans and wildlife.In the United States, the Massachusetts Cape Wind project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns"
"However, residents in other areas have been more positive"
"According to a town councilor, the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the Ardrossan Wind Farm in Scotland has enhanced the area"
"These concerns, when directed against renewable energy, are sometimes described as ""not in my back yard"" attitude (NIMBY).
A 2011 UK Government document states that ""projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities"
"This means giving communities both a say and a stake"""
"In countries such as Germany and Denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities, particularly through cooperative structures, and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment.


=== Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy ===


=== Geopolitics ===

From around 2010 onwards, the geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy has been discussed"
"Some argue that former fossil fuels exporters will experience a weakening of their position in international affairs, while countries with abundant renewable energy resources will be strengthened"
Also some countries rich in critical materials for renewable energy technologies are expected to rise in importance in international affairs.The GeGaLo index of geopolitical gains and losses assesses how the geopolitical position of 156 countries may change if the world fully transitions to renewable energy resources
"Former fossil fuels exporters are expected to lose power, while the positions of former fossil fuel importers and countries rich in renewable energy resources is expected to strengthen"
"Sourcing of required materials, ownership of key infrastructure assets and the design of grids all require geopolitics consideration.Transitions to renewable energy have many geopolitical implications such as the potential of revenue losses leading to political instability in insufficiently prepared fossil-fuel-exporting economies, albeit it is unclear whether the transition will increase or reduce conflict overall"
"In particular, a study hypothesizes that a ""configuration emerges in which fossil fuel importers are better off decarbonizing, competitive fossil fuel exporters are better off flooding markets and uncompetitive fossil fuel producers—rather than benefitting from 'free-riding'—suffer from their exposure to stranded assets and lack of investment in decarbonization technologies"".A study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining, trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems don't need fuel – they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction.Nations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters.Trade in hydrogen could fundamentally redraw the geography of the global energy trade, and international governance and investments that seek to scale up the hydrogen economy could reduce ""the risk of market fragmentation, carbon lock-in, and intensified geo-economic rivalry"""
"Electricity will overtake other energy carriers by 2050, accounting for almost 50% of total energy consumption (up from 22% in 2015)"
"Given the limitations of using solely electricity, clean hydrogen has significant potential in a number of industries"
"Hydrogen has the potential to be long-term stored in the electricity and heating industries.In 2019, oil and gas companies were listed by Forbes with sales of US$4.8 trillion, about 5% of the global GDP"
"Net importers such as China and the EU would gain advantages from a transition to low-carbon technologies driven by technological development, energy efficiency or climate change policy, while Russia, the USA or Canada could see their fossil fuel industries nearly shut down"
"On the other hand, countries with large areas such as Australia, Russia, China, the US, Canada and Brazil and also Africa and the Middle East have a potential for huge installations of renewable energy"
"The production of renewable energy technologies requires rare-earth elements with new supply chains.In October 2021, European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans suggested ""the best answer"" to the 2021 global energy crisis is ""to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."" He said those blaming the European Green Deal were doing so ""for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests."" Some critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis"
"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe is ""too reliant"" on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports"
"According to Von der Leyen, ""The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers .."
"and, crucially, with speeding up the transition to clean energy.""


== Health and environmental impact ==

Moving to modern renewable energy has very large health benefits due to reducing air pollution from fossil fuels.Renewable sources other than biomass such as wind power, photovoltaics, and hydroelectricity have the advantage of being able to conserve water, lower pollution and reduce CO2 emissions.
Solar panels change the albedo of the surface, so if used on a very large scale (such as covering 20% of the Sahara Desert), could change global weather patterns.


=== Conservation areas, recycling and rare-earth elements ===

Installations used to produce wind, solar and hydropower are an increasing threat to key conservation areas, with facilities built in areas set aside for nature conservation and other environmentally sensitive areas"
"They are often much larger than fossil fuel power plants, needing areas of land up to 10 times greater than coal or gas to produce equivalent energy amounts"
"More than 2000 renewable energy facilities are built, and more are under construction, in areas of environmental importance and threaten the habitats of plant and animal species across the globe"
The authors' team emphasized that their work should not be interpreted as anti-renewables because renewable energy is crucial for reducing carbon emissions
"The key is ensuring that renewable energy facilities are built in places where they do not damage biodiversity.The transition to renewable energy depends on non-renewable resources, such as mined metals"
"Manufacturing of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and batteries requires significant amounts of rare-earth elements which has significant social and environmental impact if mined in forests and protected areas"
" Due to co-occurrence of rare-earth and radioactive elements (thorium, uranium and radium), rare-earth mining results in production of low-level radioactive waste.In 2020 scientists published a world map of areas that contain renewable energy materials as well as estimations of their overlaps with ""Key Biodiversity Areas"", ""Remaining Wilderness"" and ""Protected Areas"""
The authors assessed that careful strategic planning is needed
"Solar panels are recycled to reduce electronic waste and create a source for materials that would otherwise need to be mined, but such business is still small and work is ongoing to improve and scale-up the process.


== History ==
Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century, nearly all energy used was renewable"
"The oldest known use of renewable energy, in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires, dates from more than a million years ago"
The use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later
Probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water
"This practice can be traced back some 7000 years, to ships in the Persian Gulf and on the Nile"
"From hot springs, geothermal energy has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times"
"Moving into the time of recorded history, the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor, animal power, water power, wind, in grain crushing windmills, and firewood, a traditional biomass.
In 1885, Werner von Siemens, commenting on the discovery of the photovoltaic effect in the solid state, wrote:

In conclusion, I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten.
Max Weber mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), published in 1905"
Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I
"The importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 Scientific American article: ""in the far distant future, natural fuels having been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of existence of the human race"".The theory of peak oil was published in 1956"
"In the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil, as well as for an escape from dependence on oil, and the first electricity-generating wind turbines appeared"
"Solar had long been used for heating and cooling, but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980.New government spending, regulation and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors.

"A carbon footprint (or greenhouse gas footprint) is a ""certain amount of gaseous emissions that are relevant to climate change and associated with human production or consumption activities"""
"In some cases, the carbon footprint is expressed as the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) which is meant to sum up the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, service, place or product"
"In other cases, only the carbon dioxide emissions are taken into account but not those of other greenhouse gases"
"Greenhouse gases, including the carbon-containing gases carbon dioxide and methane, can be emitted through the burning of fossil fuels, land clearance, and the production and consumption of food, manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other services"
"As well as calculating carbon footprints for whole countries, it is also possible to calculate the footprint of regions, cities, and neighbourhoods.The global average annual carbon footprint per person in 2014 was about 5 tonnes CO2e"
The average carbon footprint for a U.S
citizen is 16 tons
"This is one of the highest rates in the world.The use of household carbon footprint calculators originated when oil producer BP hired Ogilvy to create an ""effective propaganda"" campaign"
"Critics have said that the aim was to shift responsibility of climate change-causing pollution away from the corporations and institutions and onto personal lifestyle choices.


== Definitions ==
The IPCC uses the following definition for carbon footprint: ""Measure of the exclusive total amount of emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) that is directly and indirectly caused by an activity or is accumulated over the lifecycle stages of a product."" They chose to adopt the same definition that had been proposed in 2007 by two scientists from the UK"
"Those scientists had pointed out that there was no clear definition of the term yet.In this definition, only carbon dioxide is included in the analysis, rather than the carbon dioxide equivalents which would factor in other greenhouse gases as well"
Their reasoning for not included other greenhouse gases was that those are more difficult to quantify
An inclusion of all greenhouse gases would also make the carbon footprint indicator less practical.Some organizations use the term greenhouse gas footprint or climate footprint when all greenhouse gases are included via their global warming potential (or carbon dioxide equivalents)
"However, it is also common to understand carbon footprint in the same way, i.e"
"for all the greenhouse gases, not just for carbon dioxide"
"


== Related concepts ==


=== Ecological footprint ===
The concept and name of the carbon footprint was derived from the ecological footprint concept"
"While carbon footprints are usually reported in tons of emissions (CO2-equivalent) per year, ecological footprints are usually reported in comparison to what the planet can renew"
"This assesses the number of ""earths"" that would be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint"
The carbon footprint is one part of the ecological footprint
"Carbon footprints are more focused than ecological footprints since they merely measure emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere.Carbon footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators, which also include ecological footprints, water footprints and land footprints.


=== Carbon accounting ===


=== Greenhouse gas emissions ===


== Calculations ==

A product, service, or company's carbon footprint can be affected by several factors including, but not limited to:

Energy sources
Offsite electricity generation
MaterialsThese factors can also change with location or industry.
In most cases, the total carbon footprint cannot be calculated exactly because of inadequate knowledge of data about the complex interactions between contributing processes, including the influence of natural processes that store or release carbon dioxide"
"For this reason, Wright, Kemp, and Williams proposed the following definition of a carbon footprint:

A measure of the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions of a defined population, system or activity, considering all relevant sources, sinks and storage within the spatial and temporal boundary of the population, system or activity of interest"
"Calculated as carbon dioxide equivalent using the relevant 100-year global warming potential (GWP100).
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol has extended the range of gases"
"

 The standard covers the accounting and reporting of seven greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PCFs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).
An individual's, nation's, or organization's carbon footprint can be measured by undertaking a GHG emissions assessment, a life cycle assessment, or other calculative activities denoted as carbon accounting"
"Once the size of a carbon footprint is known, a strategy can be devised to reduce it, for example, by technological developments, energy efficiency improvements, better process and product management, changed Green Public or Private Procurement (GPP), carbon capture, consumption strategies, carbon offsetting and others.For calculating personal carbon footprints, several free online carbon footprint calculators exist.Calculating the carbon footprint of industry, product, or service is a complex task"
"One tool industry uses Life-cycle assessment (LCA), where carbon footprint may be one of many factors taken into consideration when assessing a product or service"
The International Organization for Standardization has a standard called ISO 14040:2006 that has the framework for conducting an LCA study
"ISO 14060 family of standards provides further sophisticated tools for quantifying, monitoring, reporting and validating or verifying of GHG emissions and removals"
"Another method is through the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a set of standards for tracking greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) across scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions within the value chain.Predicting the carbon footprint of a process is also possible through estimations using the above standards"
"By using Emission intensities/Carbon intensities and the estimated annual use of fuel, chemical, or other inputs, the carbon footprint can be determined while a process is being planned/designed.


=== Direct carbon emissions ===
Direct or 'scope 1' carbon emissions come from sources that are directly from the site that is producing a product or delivering a service"
An example for industry would be the emissions related to burning a fuel on site
"On the individual level, emissions from personal vehicles or gas burning stoves would fall under scope 1.


=== Indirect carbon emissions ===

Indirect carbon emissions are emissions from sources upstream or downstream from the process being studied, also known as scope 2 or scope 3 emissions.Examples of upstream, indirect carbon emissions may include:
Transportation of materials/fuels
Any energy used outside of the production facility
Wastes produced outside of the production facilityExamples of downstream, indirect carbon emissions may include:
Any end-of-life process or treatments
Product and waste transportation
Emissions associated with selling the productScope 2 emissions are the other indirect related to purchased electricity, heat, and/or steam used on site.Scope 3 emissions are all other indirect emissions derived from the activities of an organization but from sources which they do not own or control"
"The GHG Protocol's Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard allows companies to assess their entire value chain emissions impact and identify where to focus reduction activities.


== By country ==

According to The World Bank, the global average carbon footprint in 2014 was 4.97 metric tons CO2 per person"
"The EU average for 2007 was about 13.8 tons CO2e per person, whereas for the U.S., Luxembourg and Australia it was over 25 tons CO2e per person"
"In 2017, the average for the USA was about 20 metric tons CO2e per person.
The footprints per capita of countries in Africa and India were well below average"
"To set these numbers into context, assuming a global population around 9–10 billion by 2050 a carbon footprint of about 2–2.5 tons CO2e per capita is needed to stay within a 2 °C target"
"The carbon footprint calculations are based on a consumption based approach using a Multi-Regional Input-Output database, which accounts for all  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the global supply chain and allocates them to the final consumer of the purchased commodities"
"GHG emissions related to land use cover change are not included.


== By sector ==


== By products ==

Several organizations offer footprint calculators for public and corporate use, and several organizations have calculated carbon footprints of products.The Carbon Trust has worked with UK manufacturers on foods, shirts and detergents, introducing a CO2 label in March 2007"
The label is intended to comply with a new British Publicly Available Specification (i.e
"not a standard), PAS 2050, and is being actively piloted by The Carbon Trust and various industrial partners"
"As of August 2012 The Carbon Trust state they have measured 27,000 certifiable product carbon footprints.Food contributes 10-30% of a household’s carbon footprint, mainly attributed to agricultural practices like food production and transportation"
"Meat products have larger carbon footprints than plant products like vegetables and grains due to inefficient conversion of plant energy to animals, and the release of methane from manure.The precise carbon footprint of different textiles varies considerably according to a wide range of factors"
"Accounting for durability and energy required to wash and dry textile products, synthetic fabrics generally have a substantially lower carbon footprint than natural ones.The carbon footprint of materials (also known as embodied carbon) varies widely"
"The carbon footprint of many common materials can be found in the Inventory of Carbon & Energy database, the GREET databases and models, and LCA databases via openLCA Nexus"
"The carbon footprint of any manufactured product should be verified by a third-party.


== Critique ==

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term ""carbon footprint"" was first used in a BBC vegetarian food magazine in 1999, though the broader concept of ""environmental footprint"" had been used since at least 1979"
"The idea of a personal carbon footprint was popularized by a large advertising campaign of the fossil fuel company BP in 2005, designed by Ogilvy"
"It instructed people to calculate their personal footprints and provided ways for people to ""go on a low-carbon diet"".This strategy, also employed by other major fossil fuel companies, is now being criticized for trying to shift the blame for negative consequences of those industries onto individual choices"
"Geoffrey Supran and Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University have argued that concepts such as carbon footprints ""hamstring us, and they put blinders on us, to the systemic nature of the climate crisis and the importance of taking collective action to address the problem"".Others see the concept more positively"
"Hiroko Tabuchi, climate correspondent of The New York Times, argues that it is ""still a useful concept, though"
"It allows us to see that the carbon footprint of a typical American is many times that of a resident of the Global South"", encourages comparisions between individuals, companies, and countries, and reminds people that ""individual actions do matter"".The strategy has had some success, with a rise in consumers concerned about their own personal actions, and creation of multiple carbon footprint calculators.


== Reducing carbon footprints ==


=== Global perspective ===
The latest climate science is published in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report"
The report presents key scientific findings linking the increase in anthropogenic GHGs emissions in current climate change
"According to the report, it is only possible to avoid warming of 1.5 °C or 2 °C if massive and immediate cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are made"
"This is part of climate change mitigation measures.


=== Ways to reduce personal carbon footprint ===


=== Ways to reduce industry's carbon footprint ===

Reforestation, the restocking of existing forests or woodlands that have previously been depleted, is an example of Carbon Offsetting, the counteracting of carbon dioxide emissions with an equivalent reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere"
"Carbon offsetting can reduce a companies overall carbon footprint by offering a carbon credit.
Supply chain emissions (scope 3) are on average 11.4 times higher than operational emissions, more than double previous estimates, due to suppliers improving their emissions accounting"
"Therefore, there is an increasing focus on companies reducing their emissions coming from their suppliers as a way to reduce risks and capture opportunities.
A life cycle or supply chain carbon footprint study can provide useful data which will help the business to identify specific and critical areas for improvement"
By calculating or predicting a process’ carbon footprint high emissions areas can be identified and steps can be taken to reduce in those areas
"Collecting real data from suppliers emissions, setting a strategy focused on hot-spots and incentivizing suppliers are still barriers for companies"
"Nevertheless, solutions exist and the focus should be on improving year-on-year.
